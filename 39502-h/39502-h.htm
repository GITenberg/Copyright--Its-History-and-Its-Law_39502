<h2 class="p4">FOREWORD</h2>

<p class="p2 sidenote">Copyright progress</p>

<p>The American copyright code of 1909, comprehensively replacing all
previous laws, a gratifying advance in legislation despite its serious
restrictions and minor defects, places American copyright practice on a
new basis. The new British code, brought before Parliament in 1910, and
finally adopted in December, 1911, to be effective July 1, 1912, marks a
like forward step for the British Empire, enabling the mother country and
its colonies to participate in the Berlin convention. Among the
self-governing Dominions made free to accept the British code or legislate
independently, Australia had already adopted in 1905 a complete new code,
and Canada is following its example in the measure proposed in 1911, which
will probably be conformed to the new British code for passage in 1912.
Portugal has already in 1911 joined the family of nations by adherence to
the Berlin convention, Russia has shaped and Holland is shaping domestic
legislation to the same end, and even China in 1910 decreed copyright
protection throughout its vast empire of ancient and reviving letters. The
Berlin convention of 1908 strengthened and broadened the bond of the
International Copyright Union, and the Buenos Aires convention of 1910,
which the United States has already ratified, made a new basis for
copyright protection throughout the Pan American Union, both freeing
authors from formalities beyond those required in the country of origin.
Thus the American dream of 1838 of "a universal republic of letters whose
foundation shall be one just law" is well on the way toward
realization.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="Page_vi"></a>Field for the present treatise</p>

<p>In this new stage of copyright development, a comprehensive work on
copyright seemed desirable, especially with reference to the new American
code. Neither Eaton S. Drone nor George Haven Putnam were disposed to
enter upon the task, which has therefore fallen to the present writer. He
hopes that his participation for the last twenty-five years in copyright
development,&mdash;during which, as editor of the <i>Publishers'
Weekly</i> and of the <i>Library Journal</i>, he has had occasion to keep
watch of copyright progress, and as vice-president of the American
(Authors) Copyright League, he has taken part in the copyright conferences
and hearings and in the drafting of the new code,&mdash;will serve to make
the present volume of use to his fellow members of the Authors Club and to
like craftsmen, as well as to publishers and others, and aid in clarifying
relations and preventing the waste and cost of litigation among the
coördinating factors in the making of books and other forms of
intellectual property.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Authorities and acknowledgments</p>

<p>The present work includes some of the historical material of the
Bowker-Solberg volume of 1886, "Copyright, its law and its literature."
This material has been verified, extended and brought up to date,
especially in the somewhat detailed sketch of the copyright discussions
and legislation resulting in the "international copyright amendment" of
1891 and the code of 1909. The volume is in this respect practically, and
in other respects entirely new. It has had the advantage of the cordial
co-operation of the copyright authorities at Washington, especially the
Librarian of Congress, Herbert Putnam, and the Register of Copyrights,
Thorvald Solberg; also of helpful courtesy from the Canadian Minister of
Agriculture in the recent Laurier administration, Sidney Fisher, and the
Canadian Registrar of Copyrights, P. E. Ritchie, and of Prof. Ernest
Röthlisberger, editor of the <i>Droit d'Auteur</i>, and one of the best
authorities on international copyright. This acknowledgment of obligation
is not to be taken as assuming for the work official sanction and
authority, though so far as practicable, it reflects the opinions of the
best authorities. The writer has also consulted freely&mdash;but it is
hoped always within the limits of "fair use"&mdash;the best law book
writers, especially Drone, Copinger, Colles and Hardy, and MacGillivray,
to whom acknowledgment is made in the several chapters. Acknowledgment is
also made for the courtesies of Sir Frederick Macmillan, G. Herbert
Thring, secretary of the British Society of Authors, and others numerous
beyond naming. But most of all the writer is indebted to the intelligent
and capable helpfulness of Carl L. Jellinghaus, who as private secretary,
has been both right hand and eyes to the writer, and besides participating
in the work of research, is largely responsible for the index and other
"equipment" of the volume.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Method and form</p>

<p>Copyright law is exceptionally confused and confusing, and even the new
American and British codes are not without such defects. Specific subjects
are so interdependent that it has been difficult to make clear lines of
division among the several chapters, and there is necessarily repetition;
it has been the endeavor to concentrate the main discussion in one place,
designated in the index by black face figures, with subordinate references
in other chapters. Ambiguities in the text of this volume often reflect
ambiguities in the laws, particularly of foreign countries. Where acts,
decisions, etc., are quoted in the text or given in the appendix,
spelling, capitalization, punctuation, headings, etc., follow usually the
respective forms, thus involving apparent inconsistencies. Side-headings
in the appendix follow usually the official form, unless shortened to
prevent displacement. Translations of foreign conventions follow usually
the official text of the translation, but have been corrected or conformed
in case of evident error or variance. Citation of cases is confined for
the most part to ruling or recent cases or those of historic importance or
interest. Though it has not been practicable to verify statements from the
copyright laws of so many countries in divers languages, a fairly
comprehensive and accurate statement of the <i>status</i> of copyright
throughout the world is here presented. The present work, originally
planned for publication in 1910, has been held back and alterations and
insertions made to bring the record of legislation to the close of 1911.
For those who wish to keep their copyright knowledge up to date, the
<i>Publishers' Weekly</i> will endeavor to present information as to the
English speaking world, and the monthly issues of the <i>Droit
d'Auteur</i> of Berne, under the editorship of Prof. Röthlisberger, will
be found a comprehensive and adequate guide.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Advocates of authors' rights</p>

<p>The preparation of this work brings a recurring sense of the losses
which the copyright cause has suffered during the long campaign for
copyright reform, beginning in the American Copyright League, under the
presidency of James Russell Lowell, and continued under that of Edmund
Clarence Stedman, both of whom have passed over to the majority. Bronson
Howard, always active in the counsels of the League as a vice-president,
and the foremost advocate of dramatic copyright as president of the
American Dramatists Club, failed, like Stedman, to see the fulfillment of
his labors in the passage of the act of 1909. George Parsons Lathrop,
Edward Eggleston, Richard Watson Gilder, "Mark Twain" and other ardent
advocates of the rights of the author, gave large share of enthusiasm and
effort to the cause. Happily the two men who for the last twenty years and
more have labored at the working oar for the Authors League and for the
Publishers League, are still active in the good work, ready to defend the
code against attack and eager to forward every betterment that can be
made; to Robert Underwood Johnson, the successor of the lamented Gilder as
editor of the Century, and to George Haven Putnam, the head of the firm
which still bears the name of his honored father, authors the world over
owe in great measure the progress which has been made in America toward a
higher ideal for the protection of authors' rights.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Copyright evolution</p>

<p>It may be noted that while throughout the British Empire English
precedent is naturally followed, the more restrictive American copyright
system has unfortunately influenced legislation in Canada and
Newfoundland, and in Australia. France, open-handed to authors of other
countries, has afforded precedent for the widest international protection
and for the international term; while Spain, with the longest term and
most liberal arrangements otherwise, has been followed largely by Latin
American countries. The International Copyright Union has reached in the
Berlin convention almost the ideal of copyright legislation, and this has
been closely followed in the Buenos Aires convention of the Pan American
Union. The world over, there seems to have been a general evolution of
copyright protection from the rude and imperfect recognition of
intellectual property as cognate to other property, for a term indefinite
and in a sense perpetual, almost impossible of enforcement in the lack of
statutory protection and penalties. Systems of legislation, at first of
very limited term and of restricted scope, have led up to the
comprehensive codes giving wide and definite protection for all classes of
intellectual property for a term of years extending beyond life, with the
least possible formalities compatible with the necessities of legal
procedure. Unfortunately in the United States of America the forward
movement which produced the "international copyright amendment" of 1891
and the code of 1909, conspicuously excellent despite defects of detail,
was in some measure offset by retrogression, as in the manufacturing
restrictions. Until this policy, which still remains a blot on the
'scutcheon, is abandoned, as the friends of copyright hope may ultimately
be the case, the United States of America cannot enter on even terms the
family of nations and become part of the United States of the world.</p>

<p>December, 1911.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Postscript.</span> Since this book has been passing
through the press, Cuba has been added to the countries in reciprocal
relations with the United States with respect to mechanical music by the
President's proclamation of November 27, 1911; Russia has made with France
its first copyright treaty, in conformity with the new Russian code of
1911; and the new British code, referred to on p. 33, having passed the
House of Commons August 17, passed the House of Lords December 6, and
after concurrence by the House of Commons in minor amendments, mostly
verbal, became law by Crown approval, December 16, 1911, as noted on p.
374. The text of the act in the appendix follows the official text as it
now stands on the English statute books; the summary (pp. 374-80)
describes the act as it became law&mdash;and the earlier references are in
accordance therewith, with a few exceptions. These exceptions mostly
concern immaterial changes, made in the House of Lords. Within January,
1912, Brazil has adopted a new measure for international copyright, and a
treaty has been signed between the United States and Hungary, the
twenty-fifth nation in reciprocal relations with this country.</p>

<p class="p2">Under the names of countries are given dates of the basic

in <span class="smcap">small caps</span> of the convention city when a
country is a party to the International Copyright Union or the Pan
American conventions, and by the names of countries with which there are
specific treaties, excepting those within the union or conventions. The
general term of duration is entered, without specification of special
terms for specific classes. Places of registration and deposit are
indicated by R and D when these are not the same. The number of copies
required and in some cases period after publication within which deposit

<p>The International Copyright Union includes (A) under the Berlin
convention, 1908 (a) without reservation Germany, Belgium, Luxemburg,
Switzerland, Spain, Monaco, Liberia, Haiti, Portugal, and (b) with
reservation France, Norway, Tunis, Japan; (B) under the Berne convention,
1886, and the Paris additional act and interpretative declaration, 1896,
Denmark, Italy; (C) under the Berne convention, 1886, and the Paris
additional act, 1896, Great Britain; (D) under the Berne convention, 1886,
and the Paris interpretative declaration, 1896, Sweden. The Pan American
conventions agreed on at Mexico City, 1902, Rio de Janeiro, 1906, and
Buenos Aires, 1910, have not been ratified except that of Mexico by the
United States and by Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Salvador,
and doubtfully by Cuba and Dominican Republic; that of Rio by a few states
insufficient to make it anywhere operative; and that of Buenos Aires by
the United States. The South American convention of Montevideo, 1889, has
been accepted by Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, Peru and Bolivia, and
has the adherence (in relation with Argentina and Paraguay only) of
Belgium, France, Italy and Spain. The five Central American states have a
mutual convention through their Washington treaty of peace of 1907.</p>

<h2 class="p4">COPYRIGHT</h2>

<h3 class="larger">ITS HISTORY AND ITS LAW</h3>

<h3 class="p2">I</h3>
<h4>THE NATURE AND ORIGIN OF COPYRIGHT</h4>

<p class="p2 sidenote"><a name="1a"></a>Copyright, meaning</p>

<p>Copyright (from the Latin <i>copia</i>, plenty) means, in general, the
right to copy, to make plenty. In its specific application it means the
right to multiply copies of those products of the human brain known as
literature and art.</p>

<p>There is another legal sense of the word "copyright" much emphasized by
several English justices. Through the low Latin use of the word
<i>copia</i>, our word "copy" has a secondary and reversed meaning, as the
pattern to be copied or made plenty, in which sense the schoolboy copies
from the "copy" set in his copy-book, and the modern printer calls for the
author's "copy."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="1b"></a>Its two senses</p>

<p>Copyright, accordingly, may also mean the right in copy made (whether
the original work or a duplication of it), as well as the right to make
copies, which by no means goes with the work or any duplicate of it. Said
Lord St. Leonards in the case of Jefferys v. Boosey in 1854: "When we are
talking of the right of an author we must distinguish between the mere
right to his manuscript, and to any copy which he may choose to make of
it, as his property, just like any other personal chattel, and the right
to multiply copies to the exclusion of every other person. Nothing can be
more distinct than these two <a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 2]</span>things. The common law does give a man who
has composed a work a right to that composition, just as he has a right to
any other part of his personal property; but the question of the right of
excluding all the world from copying, and of himself claiming the
exclusive right of forever copying his own composition after he has
published it to the world, is a totally different thing." Baron Parke, in
the same case, pointed out expressly these two different legal senses of
the word copyright, the right <i>in</i> copy, a right of possession,
always fully protected by the common law, and the right <i>to</i> copy, a
right of multiplication, which alone has been the subject of special
statutory protection.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="2"></a>Blackstone</p>

<p>Blackstone in his Commentaries of 1767, in which the word copyright
seems to have been first used, lays down the fundamental principles of
copyright as follows: "When a man, by the exertion of his rational powers,
has produced an original work, he seems to have clearly a right to dispose
of that identical work as he pleases, and any attempt to vary the
disposition he has made of it appears to be an invasion of that right. Now
the identity of a literary composition consists entirely in the sentiment
and the language; the same conceptions, clothed in the same words, must
necessarily be the same composition; and whatever method be taken of
exhibiting that composition to the ear or the eye of another, by recital,
by writing, or by printing, in any number of copies, or at any period of
time, it is always the identical work of the author which is so exhibited;
and no other man (it hath been thought) can have a right to exhibit it,
especially for profit, without the author's consent. This consent may,
perhaps, be tacitly given to all mankind, when an author suffers his work
to be published by another hand, without any claim or reserve <a
name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 3]</span>of right,
and without stamping on it any marks of ownership; it being then a present
to the public, like building a church or bridge, or laying out a new
highway."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="3"></a>Property by creation</p>

<p>There is nothing which may more rightfully be called property than the
creation of the individual brain. For property (from the Latin
<i>proprius</i>, own) means a man's very <i>own</i>, and there is nothing
more his own than the thought, created, made out of no material thing
(unless the nerve-food which the brain consumes in the act of thinking be
so counted), which uses material things only for its record or
manifestation. The best proof of <i>own</i>-ership is that if this
individual man or woman had not thought this individual thought, realized
in writing or in music or in marble, it would not exist. Or if the
individual thinking it had put it aside without such record, it would not,
in any practical sense, exist. We cannot know what "might have beens" of
untold value have been lost to the world where thinkers, such as
inventors, have had no inducement or opportunity thus to materialize their
thoughts.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Are thoughts created?</p>

<p>It is sometimes said, as a bar to this idea of property, that no
thought is new&mdash;that every thinker is dependent upon the gifts of
nature and the thoughts of other thinkers before him, as every tiller of
the soil is dependent upon the land as given by nature and improved by the
men who have toiled and tilled before him,&mdash;a view of which Henry C.
Carey has been the chief exponent in this country. But there is no real
analogy&mdash;aside from the question whether the denial of individual
property in land would not be setting back the hands of progress. If
Farmer Jones does not raise potatoes from a piece of land, Farmer Smith
can; but Shakespeare cannot write "Paradise lost" nor Milton "Much ado,"
though before both <a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 4]</span>Dante dreamed and Boccaccio told his tales.
It was because of Milton and Shakespeare writing, not because of Dante and
Boccaccio who had written, that these immortal works are treasures of the
English tongue. It was the very self of each, <i>in propria persona</i>,
that gave these form and worth, though they used words that had come down
from generations as the common heritage of English-speaking men. Property
in a stream of water, as has been pointed out, is not in the atoms of the
water but in the flow of the stream.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="4"></a>Property in unpublished works</p>

<p>Property right in unpublished works has never been effectively
questioned&mdash;a fact which in itself confirms the view that
intellectual property is a natural inherent right. The author has "supreme
control" over an unpublished work, and his manuscript cannot be utilized
by creditors as assets without his consent. "If he lends a copy to
another," says Baron Parke, "his right is not gone; if he sends it to
another under an implied undertaking that he is not to part with it or
publish it, he has a right to enforce that undertaking." The receiver of a
letter, to whom the paper containing the writing has undoubtedly been
given, has no right to publish or otherwise use the letter without the
writer's consent. The theory that by permitting copies to be made, an
author dedicates his writing to the public, as an owner of land dedicates
a road to the public by permitting public use of it for twenty-one years,
overlooks the fact that in so doing the author only conveys to each holder
of his book the right to individual use, and not the right to multiply
copies, as though the landowner should not give but sell permission to
individuals to pass over his road, without any permission to them to sell
tickets for the same privilege to other people. The owner of a right does
not forfeit a right by selling a privilege.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="5a"></a>The question of publication</p>

<p><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 5]</span>It
is at the moment of publication that the undisputed possessory right
passes over into the much disputed right to multiply copies, and that the
vexed question of the true theory of copyright property arises. The broad
view of literary property holds that the one kind of copyright is involved
in the other. The right to have is the right to use. An author cannot
use&mdash;that is, get beneficial results from&mdash;his work, without
offering copies for sale. He would be otherwise like the owner of a loaf
of bread who was told that the bread was his until he wanted to eat it.
That sale would seem to contain "an implied undertaking" that the buyer
has liberty to use his copy, but not to multiply it. Peculiarly in this
kind of property the right of ownership consists in the right to prevent
use of one's property by others without the owner's consent. The right of
exclusion seems to be indeed a part of ownership. In the case of land the
owner is entitled to prevent trespass, to the extent of a shot-gun, and in
the same way the law recognizes the right to use violence, even to the
extreme, in preventing others from possession of one's own property of any
kind. The owner of a literary property has, however, no physical means of
defence or redress; the very act of publication by which he gets a market
for his productions opens him to the danger of wider multiplication and
publication without his consent. There is, therefore, no kind of property
which is so dependent on the help of the law for the protection of the
real owner.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="5b"></a>Inherent right</p>

<p>The inherent right of authors is a right at what is called common
law&mdash;that is, natural or customary law. The common law, says Kent,
"includes those principles, usages, and rules of action applicable to the
government and security of person and property which do not rest for their
authority upon <a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
6]</span>any express and positive declaration of the will of the
legislature." "The common law or <i>lex non scripta</i>," says Blackstone,
"depends upon its having been used time out of mind; or, in the solemnity
of our legal phrase, time whereof the memory of man runneth not to the
contrary." So far as concerns the undisputed rights before publication,
the copyright laws are auxiliary merely to common law. Rights exist before
remedies; remedies are merely invented to enforce rights. "The seeking for
the law of the right of property in the law of procedure relating to the
remedies," says Copinger in his standard English work on "The law of
copyright," "is a mistake similar to supposing that the mark on the ear of
an animal is the cause, instead of the consequence, of property
therein."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="6a"></a>Statutory penalties</p>

<p>After the invention of printing it became evident that new methods of
procedure must be devised to enforce common law rights. Copyright became,
therefore, the subject of statute law, by the passage of laws imposing
penalties for a theft which, without such laws, could not be punished.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="6b"></a>Statute of Anne<br />

<a name="7"></a>Supersedure of common law right</p>

<p>These laws, covering naturally only the country of the author, and
specifying a time during which the penalties could be enforced, and
providing means of registration by which authors could register their
property rights, as the title to a house is registered when it is sold,
had an unexpected result. The statute of Anne, which is the foundation of
present English copyright law, intended to protect authors' rights by
providing penalties against their violation, had the effect of limiting
those rights. It was doubtless the intention of those who framed the
statute of Anne to establish, for the benefit of authors, specific means
of redress. Overlooking apparently the fact that law and equity, as their
principles were then <a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 7]</span>established, enabled authors to use the same
means of redress, so far as they held good, which persons suffering wrongs
as to other property had, the law was so drawn that in 1774 the English
House of Lords (against, however, the weight of one half of English
judicial opinion) decided that, instead of giving additional sanction to a
formerly existing right, the statute of Anne had substituted a new and
lesser right to the exclusion of what the majority of English judges held
to have been an old and greater right. Literary and like property to this
extent lost the character of copy-<i>right</i>, and became the subject of
copy-<i>privilege</i>, depending on legal enactment for the security of
the private owner. American courts, wont to follow English precedent, have
rather taken for granted this view of the law of literary property, and
our Constitution, in authorizing Congress to secure "for limited times to
authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and
discoveries," was evidently drawn from the same point of view, though it
does not in itself deny or withdraw the natural rights of the author at
common law.</p>

<h3 class="p2">II</h3>

<h4>THE EARLY HISTORY OF COPYRIGHT</h4>

<p class="p2 sidenote"><a name="8a"></a>In classic times</p>

<p>Our traditions of the blind Homer, singing his Iliad in the
multitudinous places of his protean nativity, do not vouchsafe us any
information as to the <i>status</i> of authors in his day. There seems
indeed to be no indication of author's rights or literary property in
Greek or earlier literatures. But there is mention in Roman literature of
the sale of playright by the dramatic authors, as Terence; and Rome had
booksellers who sold copies of poems written out by slaves, and who seem
to have been protected by some kind of "courtesy of the trade," since
Martial names certain booksellers who had specific poems of his for sale.
Horace complains that the Sosius brothers, his publishers, got gold while
he got only fame&mdash;but this may have been a classic "author's
grumble." Cicero in his letters indicates that there was some notion of
literary property, and it is probable that some kind of payment was made
to authors.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="8b"></a>Roman law</p>

<p>The Roman jurist Gaius, probably of the second century, held that where
an artist had painted upon a <i>tabula</i>, his was the superior right.
And this opinion was adopted by Tribonian, chief editor of the code of
Justinian, in the sixth century, and was applied in a modern question in
respect to John Leech's drawings upon wood.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="8c"></a>Monastic copyists<br />

<a name="9a"></a>St. Columba and Finnian</p>

<p>In the early Christian centuries, the monasteries became the seats of
learning, and the <i>scriptorium</i> or writing room, in connection with
the <i>librarium</i> or <i>armarium</i>,&mdash;the armory in which the
weapons of the <a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
9]</span>faith were kept,&mdash;was the work-shop of the monkish copyists,
sometimes working as a publishing staff under the direction of the
<i>librarius</i> or <i>armarius</i> as chief scribe. The first record of a
copyright case is that of Finnian <i>v</i>. Columba in 567, chronicled by
Adamnan fifty years later and cited by Montalembert in "The monks of the
West." St. Columba, in his pre-saintly days, surreptitiously made a copy
of a psalter in possession of his teacher Finnian, and the copy was
reclaimed, so the tradition relates, under the decision of King Dermott,
in the Halls of Tara: "To every cow her calf." The authenticity of the
tradition is questioned by other writers, but the phrase gives the pith of
the common law doctrine of literary property and indicates that in those
early centuries there was a sense of copyright. Monks from other
monasteries came to a noted <i>scriptorium</i> where a specially authentic
or valuable manuscript could be copied, and the privilege of copying
sometimes became the basis of an exchange of copies or of a commercial
charge. Finally different texts of the same work were compared to obtain a
certain or standard text, and the multiplication of such copies became the
basis of a publishing and bookselling trade, in secular as well as
sacerdotal hands, the development of which is traced in detail by George
Haven Putnam in "Books and their makers in the Middle Ages."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="9b"></a>University protection</p>

<p>This development is illustrated in the statutes of 1223 of the
University of Paris, providing that the "booksellers of the University"
should produce duplicate copies of the texts authorized for the use of the
University, and there is indication that payment was made by the
University to scholars for the annotation and proof-reading of such texts.
In fact, there existed in France in those days a kind of guild of <a
name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
10]</span><i>libraires jurés</i> or legalized booksellers, under
regulation of the University, as a body of publishers and writers having
jurisdiction over the copying and censorship of manuscripts. "Letters of
patent" of Charles V, 1368, specified fourteen <i>libraires</i> and eleven
<i>écrivains</i> as registered in Paris, and four chief <i>libraires</i>
had jurisdiction over the calling of the <i>librarius</i> and the
<i>stationarius</i>. The certificate of the correctness of a copy, and
perhaps of the right to copy or sell it, may be considered the primitive
form of copyright certificate.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="10a"></a>Invention of printing</p>

<p>The invention of printing, prior to 1450, made protection of literary
property a question of rapidly increasing importance. The new art raised,
of course, many new questions wherever the guardians of the law were set
to their chronic task of applying old ideas of right to new conditions.
The earliest copyright certificate, if it may be so called, in a printed
book was that in the reissue of the tractate of Peter Nigrus printed in
1475, at Esslingen, in which the Bishop of Ratisbon certified the
correctness of the copy and his approval. At first "privileges" were
granted chiefly to printers, for the reproduction of classic or patristic
works, but possibly in some cases as the representatives of living
writers; and there are early instances of direct grants to authors, the
earliest known being in 1486 in Venice to Sabellico.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="10b"></a>In Germany</p>

<p>In Germany, the cradle of the art of printing, whence come the earliest
<i>incunabula</i> or cradle-books, printing privileges were developed some
decades later than in Italy. Koberger, the early Nuremberg printer, whose
imprint dates back to 1473, relied rather on the "courtesy of the trade,"
and indeed made an agreement in 1495 with Kessler of Basel to respect each
other's rights. Yet a suit brought in 1480 by Schöffer, who with Fust had
established the first <a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 11]</span>publishing and bookselling business, brought
in connection with Fust's heirs against Inkus of Frankfort for the
infringement of property rights in certain books, and the issue of a
preliminary injunction by a court at Basel, indicated some definite legal
<i>status</i>.</p>

<p>The first recorded privilege in Germany was issued by the imperial
Aulic Council in 1501, to the Rhenish Celtic Sodalitas for the printing of
dramas of the nun-poet, Hroswitha, who had been dead for 600 years, as
prepared by Celtes of Nuremberg. The imperial privilege covered only the
imperial domain, and Celtes in the same year obtained a similar privilege
from the magistracy of Frankfort, then the seat of the book-fair,
organized there about 1500, afterwards superseded by that at Leipzig.
Later, imperial privileges were issued by the Imperial Chancellor in the
name of the Emperor, as one in 1510 to the printer Johann Schott of the
"<i>Lectura aurea</i>." In 1512 Maximilian I granted to the
historiographer Johann Stab in Lintz a privilege covering "all works"
which he "might cause to be printed," under which he issued licenses on
particular books for ten years or less. This grant, however, some
authorities consider not a privilege or copyright, but an authorization to
license, possibly similar to that which had been granted in 1455 by
Frederick III and confirmed later by Maximilian I to Dr. Jacob Össler at
Strasburg, perhaps the earliest centre of printing and bookselling, as
imperial supervisor of literature and superintendent of printing. In 1512
also, copies or imitations or engravings by Albert Dürer, with forged
signature, were ordered confiscated by the magistrates of Nuremberg,
though perhaps on grounds of fraud rather than of copyright. But in 1528
Dürer's widow obtained from the Nuremberg authorities exclusive privilege
for his works, and in <a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 12]</span>that year the magistrates went so far in
protecting Dürer's "Proportion" as to restrain another work of the same
title and subject, presumably though mistakenly inferred to be an
adaptation or imitation, until after the completion and sale of the
original work. In 1532 reëngravings of some of Dürer's works were
restrained, and when a Latin edition of his "Perspective," printed in
Paris, found its way to Nuremberg, the magistrates called the booksellers
together, warned them against keeping or selling the unauthorized edition,
and sent letters to the magistracy of Strasburg, Frankfort, Leipzig and
Antwerp, requesting similar action. Luther in his reforming zeal was the
first protestant against authors' wrongs, and in a letter of 1528
complained that "there are many now busying themselves with the spoiling
of books through misprinting them," and pleaded for legislation to protect
literary producers. In 1531 the city council of Basel enjoined all
booksellers from reprinting the books of each other for three years from
publication under penalty of one hundred gulden, which illustrates the
nature of local legislation, privileging printers as well as other guilds
within a city. The protection was usually for short terms and sometimes
covered the subject as well as the book, as indicated in the Dürer
case.</p>

<p>The coördinate jurisdiction of imperial and local authority continued
into the seventeenth century, and besides a special protection of official
publications, including church texts and school books, there developed a
differentiation between privileged books and protected authors. The
imperial city of Frankfort in 1660 passed an ordinance for the protection
of "<i>bücher</i>" and "<i>autores</i>" and an imperial patent of 1685
made the curious distinction between "privileged" and "unprivileged"
works, which Pütter, <a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 13]</span>reputed the German apostle of the modern
theory of property in literary productions, writing in 1764, explains as
meaning respectively "non-individual" and "individual"
(<i>eigenthümlich</i>) works, the former those issued under printers'
privileges, the latter the works of contemporary authors, copyrightable in
our modern sense. At the close of the seventeenth century, the book-fair
at Leipzig began to assume dominating importance, and the privileges from
the Commission of the Elector of Saxony became more authoritative,
perhaps, than the imperial privileges issued from Frankfort.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="13"></a>In Italy: Venice</p>

<p>Venice, among whose chief glories were to be the master printers Aldus,
was the first and foremost of the Italian states to encourage the new art.
The first privilege granted by her Senate, in 1469, indeed ante-dated the
first in Germany by thirty-two years, the first in France by thirty-four
years, and the first in England by forty-nine years. This was to John of
Speyer, a German printer, for a monopoly for printing in Venice for five
years, with prohibition of importation of works printed elsewhere, which
he did not live to enjoy. The first known author's copyright was granted
September 1, 1486, to Antonio Sabellico, historian to the Republic, of the
sole right to publish or authorize the publication of his "Decade of
Venetian affairs," not limited in time, with a penalty of five hundred
ducats for infringement. In 1491 the Senate gave to the publicist Peter of
Ravenna and the publisher of his choice the sole right, without mention of
term, to print and sell his "Ph&oelig;nix," usually cited as the first
instance of copyright. In 1493 one Barbaro was granted a privilege for ten
years in the work of his deceased brother, and in the same year an
editor's copyright was granted to Joannes Nigro for his edition of
"Haliabas," his application <a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 14]</span> being accompanied by a certificate from
learned doctors of Padua of its value for the community, and a publisher's
copyright to Benaliis on Giustiniani's "Origin of the city of Venice,"
both apparently without term. In 1494 a privilege to Codeca contained the
condition of fair price, and another privilege required publication within
a year or at the rate of a folio a day. In 1496 Aldus himself was given
the privilege for twenty years of printing any Greek texts, and in 1501,
another for ten years of printing in cursive or italic characters, an
invention of his own modeled on the handwriting of Boccaccio, a
<i>quasi</i> patent right; and rights for other languages were granted to
other printers.</p>

<p>From 1505 renewals were granted for good cause, as in 1508 to Crasso
for his edition of the works of Polifilo, because the wars had prevented
due return. The privilege dated sometimes from application, sometimes from
publication, and varied in term from one year up, averaging perhaps ten
years at the beginning and twenty years toward the close of the sixteenth
century. Many of the privileges were conditioned on printing within
Venice. Copyright to authors became frequent, as in 1515 on his "Orlando"
for his lifetime, to Ariosto, on whose poems an extra term for ten years
was granted, in 1535, to his heirs. In 1521 Castellazzo obtained a
copyright for his engravings illustrating the Pentateuch and for others
which he had in plan; and many musical works were also copyrighted.</p>

<p>It will be seen that before or early in the sixteenth century most of
the copyright conditions of later legislation, even in the American code
of 1909, had been prophesied in Venice. But the privileges had become so
complicated and perplexing that in 1517 the Venetian Senate abolished all
printing privileges <a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 15]</span> previously granted and decreed that
privileges should thereafter be granted only by two-thirds vote and for a
new work (<i>opus novum</i>) "never published before," or works hitherto
unprivileged. This attempt at reform proved inadequate and indefinite, and
in 1533 the first real copyright code was decreed, under which printing
was required within Venice, and publication within a year&mdash;later
modified for larger works to a folio a day. No publisher could apply twice
for the same copyright, and a maximum price was fixed from an advance copy
by the Bureau of Arts and Industries. Under the restriction of
competition, Venetian printers, once the best in the world, fell into "the
ruinous and disgraceful practice," according to a decree of 1537, "for the
sake of gain" of using "vile paper that would not hold the ink" or permit
marginal notes; and the use of good paper that could be written upon
without blotting was required, except for works priced under 10 soldi, on
penalty of forfeiture of copyright and a fine of 100 ducats. Under the
earlier privileges publishers had printed books without consent of the
authors or against their will, but in 1545 it was decreed that no
copyright should issue unless documentary evidence of the consent of the
author or his representatives had been submitted to the Rifformatori, the
commission from the University of Padua, appointed the year before as
censors upon non-theological works, not covered by the ecclesiastical
censors.</p>

<p>A decree in 1548 established a guild of printers and publishers,
antedating the charter granted by Queen Mary to the Stationers' Company in
London, though later than the organization of the book-fair of Frankfort
and of the <i>libraires jurés</i> in France; and its regulations, aiding
the censorship, incidentally defined literary property and protected
copyrights. <a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
16]</span>About 1566 there was a provision that works should be registered
before publication without charge, and a complete registry of published
works was kept in Venice. In 1569 as many as 117 copyright entries were
made in Venice, and so few, after the plague years, as seven in 1599. Only
two applications are recorded as refused by the Senate. The one recorded
instance of punishment for piracy was that on the work of Pappa Alesio of
Corfu, wherein the infringer was fined 200 ducats, besides ten ducats for
each unauthorized copy printed, and was forbidden to print for ten
years.</p>

<p>About 1600 the exodus of printers from Venice was checked by
legislation, and in 1603 an elaborate decree provided copyright for twenty
years on books first published in Venice, for ten years on books first
published in Italy but registered in Venice, or on books not printed in
Venice within the previous twenty years, and for five years on books not
printed within ten years previous, and also a fine of twenty-five ducats
for the false use of "Venetia" in the imprint. Later, as is evidenced by
complaints in 1671, deposit copies were required for the libraries of St.
Mark and of Padua. By the close of the seventeenth century the provisions
for copyright in Venice had become so complicated, according to Putnam,
following Brown's historical study of "The Venetian printing press," as to
require the following processes, most of them involving a fee:
"<i>testamur</i> from the ducal secretary; certificate from the
Rifformatori of the University of Padua; <i>imprimatur</i> from the Chiefs
of the Ten; revision by the Superintendent of the Press; revision by the
public proof-reader; collation of the original text with the text as
printed, by the secretary to the Rifformatori; certificate from the
librarian of St. Mark that a copy had been deposited in the <a
name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
17]</span>library; examination by experts appointed by the Proveditori to
establish the market price of the book."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="17a"></a>Florence</p>

<p>Florence was second only to Venice in the production of books and the
protection of authors, and the records of Florentine printing show that in
the sixteenth century international privileges were sought and obtained.
Thus the printer of a Florentine edition of the Pandects, in 1553,
obtained privileges also in Spain, France and the two Sicilies, possibly
through a Papal grant.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="17b"></a>Control by the Church</p>

<p>By 1515, under Leo X, patron of art and letters, the Holy See had
asserted its jurisdiction over copyrights and privileges, not only in its
own territory, but throughout Italy and Germany, and elsewhere, under pain
of spiritual punishments. Fra Felice of Prato, a converted Jew, had
obtained from the Pope a privilege for certain Hebrew works valid
throughout all Europe, the denial or infringement of which was punishable
by excommunication; but he took the precaution to obtain a privilege also
from the Venetian authorities. There is other evidence of a compromise
policy involving approval from the Church before a secular privilege was
granted, especially of theological works. Throughout Catholic countries
the <i>index expurgatorius</i> banned for the most part the printing of
forbidden books; and this made Holland later the chief centre of printing,
since the placing of a work in the <i>index</i> invited prompt reprint by
Dutch publishers. It was perhaps a survival of a requirement for deposit
of such books that Holland so long remained the only nation in Europe
conditioning copyright on deposit of a copy printed within the
country.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="17c"></a>In France</p>

<p>In France, after the invention of printing, the functions of the
<i>libraires jurés</i>, under the authority given by the King through the
University of Paris, naturally <a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 18]</span> came to include books, and this relation
was continued until the Revolution of 1789. Copyrights throughout this
period seem to have been in perpetuity. At the beginning of the fifteenth
century, in the times of Louis XII, "letters of the King" forbade
booksellers, printers and other persons to "introduce foreign impressions"
of the books to which such letters were appended. They were usually issued
to printers. In 1537, under Francis I, a work had first to secure "the
King's approval given through the royal librarian," a copy must be
deposited in the library of the royal château of Blois, and the selling of
foreign works was permitted only after approval as worthy of a place in
the royal library,&mdash;but for these last the library was to pay the
usual price. In 1556 a general ordinance of Henry II defined literary
property, and publication of condemned books was declared treason. In 1566
the "Ordinance de Moulins" of Charles IX made further definition; and
letters patent of Henry III, in 1576, referred back to these earlier
ordinances. Infringement of such privileges was punished with especial
severity in France, for, as quoted by Lowndes, such conduct was thought
"worse than to enter a neighbor's house and steal his goods: for
negligence might be imputed to him for permitting the thief to enter: but
in the case of piracy of copyright, it was stealing a thing confided to
the public honor." Louis XIV in 1682 visited it with corporal punishment,
and for a second offence decreed in 1686 also that the offender should be
forever disabled from exercising his trade of bookseller or printer.</p>

<p>Copyrights continued in perpetuity until all royal privileges were
abolished in 1789 by the National Assembly, after which in July, 1793, a
general copyright law was passed, granting copyright to an author for his
life and to his heirs for ten years thereafter.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="19"></a>In England</p>

<p><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
19]</span>In England, a Royal Printer was appointed in 1504, and to his
successor, Richard Pynson, in 1518, the first printing "privilege" was
issued, in the form of a prohibition for two years of the printing by any
other person of a certain speech to which this first English copyright
notice was appended. Bishop Fell, in his memoirs on the state of printing
in the University of Oxford, states that this University had been granted
certain exclusive privileges of transcribing and multiplying books by
means of writing; and Lowndes in his early "Historical sketch of the law
of copyright," published in 1840 and 1842, cites many early privileges,
most commonly for seven years, granted after the invention of
printing.</p>

<p>An early enactment of Richard III, in 1483, had encouraged the
circulation of books by exempting from certain restraints on aliens "any
artificer, or merchant stranger, of what nation or country he be, for
bringing into this realm, or selling by retail or otherwise, any books
written or printed, or for inhabiting within this said realm for the same
intent, or any scrivener, alluminor, reader, or printer of such books."
But fifty years later, under Henry VIII, this exemption was repealed by an
act, "for printers and binders of books," which provided that no persons
"resident or inhabitant within this realm shall buy to sell again, any
printed books brought from any parts out of the King's obeysance, ready
bound in boards, leather, or parchment," or buy "of any stranger born out
of the King's obedience, other than of denizens, any manner of printed
books brought from any parties beyond the sea, except only by engross, and
not by retail"&mdash;the buyer to be punished by a fine, of which a moiety
was to go to the informer. The act also contained provisions to "reform
and redress," through the Chancery judges with <a name="Page_20"
id="Page_20"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 20]</span>"twelve honest and
discreet persons," "too high and unreasonable prices."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Book restriction</p>

<p>The quaint preamble of this act of 1533 sets forth as its "whereas," in
reference to the act of Richard III, that "there hath come to this realm
sithen the making of the same, a marvelous number of printed books, and
daily doth; and the cause of the making of the same provision seemeth to
be, for that there were but few books, and few printers within this realm
at that time, which could well exercise and occupy the said science and
craft of printing; nevertheless, sithen the making of the said provision,
many of this realm, being the King's natural subjects, have given them so
diligently to learn and exercise the said craft of printing, that at this
day there be within this realm a great number cunning and expert in the
said science or craft of printing, as able to exercise the said craft in
all points, as any stranger in any other realm or country; and
furthermore, where there be a great number of the King's subjects within
this realm, which live by the craft and mystery of binding of books, and
that there be a great multitude well expert in the same, yet all this
notwithstanding, there are divers persons that bring from beyond the sea
great plenty of printed books, not only in the Latin tongue, but also in
our maternal English tongue, some bound in boards, some in leather, and
some in parchment, and them sell by retail, whereby many of the King's
subjects, being binders of books, and having no other faculty wherewith to
get their living, be destitute of work and like to be undone, except some
reformation herein be had." This is interesting in connection with the
American manufacturing clause.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Early English protection</p>

<p>Henry VIII granted many printing privileges, and in 1530 the first
English copyright to an author was <a name="Page_21"
id="Page_21"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 21]</span> issued to John
Palsgrave, who, having prepared a French grammar at his own expense,
received a privilege for seven years. In 1533 appeared the first complaint
of piracy, that of Wynken de Worde, who obtained the King's privilege for
his second edition of Witinton's Grammar, because Peter Trevers had
reprinted it from the edition of 1523. Up to the middle of the sixteenth
century copyrights were in form printers' licenses, and even in the case
cited Palsgrave seems to have been recognized rather because he published
his own book than because he wrote it.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="21"></a>The Stationers' Company</p>

<p>The Stationers' Company, created by Henry VIII and chartered under
Queen Mary in 1556, though the development of an earlier guild dating from
1403, was in part a device to prevent seditious printing, by prohibiting
any printing in England except by those registered in its membership. In
1558, under a second charter, its by-laws provided that every one who
printed a book should register it and pay a fee, and those who failed to
do this, or who printed another member's book, were to be fined. In 1562
licenses were declared void "if any other has a right," and in 1573 sales
of "copy" are entered. The practice had grown up of granting patents or
monopolies to persons for a whole class of books; the Stationers' Company
itself held that for almanacs up to a very late period, and the Crown has
retained that on the Bible and the Book of Common Prayer to the present
day. These monopolies were defied, and the Star Chamber decree of 1566,
disabling offending printers from exercising their trade and prescribing
imprisonment, did not avail. In 1640 the Star Chamber and all the
regulations of the press were abolished by the Long Parliament, but the
abuse of unlicensed printing led to a new licensing act in 1643, which
prohibited printing or importing <a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 22]</span>without consent of the <i>owner</i>, on pain
of forfeiture of copies to the owner, and which renewed the order that all
books should be entered in the register of the Stationers' Company. The
early registers still exist in Stationers' Hall, near Paternoster Row,
London, in quaint and almost undecipherable chirography, and some of them
have been reissued in <i>facsimile</i>. It was against the licensing act
of this date that Milton, in 1644, printed his "Areopagitica," but he
particularly excepts from his criticism of the act the part providing for
"the just retaining of each man his several copy, which God forbid should
be gainsaid."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="22"></a>Statutory provisions</p>

<p>In 1649 Parliament provided a penalty of 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> and
forfeiture for the reprinting of registered books, and prohibited presses
except at London, Finsbury, York, and the universities, and in 1662 it
added the requirement of deposit of a copy at the King's library and at
each of the universities. To prevent fraudulent changes in a book after
licensing, it was further required that a copy be deposited with the
licenser at the time of application&mdash;apparently the origin of our
record-deposit. With the expiration of these acts in 1679, legislative
penalties lapsed and piracy became common. Charles II in 1684 renewed the
charter of the Stationers' Company, approved its register, and confirmed
to proprietors of books "the sole right, power, and privilege and
authority of printing, as has been usual heretofore." The licensing act of
1649-62 was revived in 1685, and renewed up to 1694, although the
booksellers now petitioned against it, and eleven peers protested against
subjecting learning to a mercenary and perhaps ignorant licenser, and
destroying the property of authors in their copies. The law lapsed because
of the indignation of the Commons against the arbitrary power of the
license, but the result was the abolition of statutory penalties, <a
name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 23]</span> which
left the punishment of piracy a matter of damages at common law, requiring
a separate action for each copy sold, usually against irresponsible
people. Piracy again flourished. The right at common law seems, however,
to have been unquestioned, and the Court of Common Pleas held that a
plaintiff who had purchased from the executors of an author was owner of
the property at common law. Owners of literary property petitioned
Parliament, 1703 to 1709, for security and redress, declaring that the
property of English authors had always been held as sacred among the
traders, that conveyance gave just and legal title, that the property was
the same with houses and other estates, and that existing "copies" had
cost at least £50,000, and had been used in marriage settlements and were
the subsistence of many widows and orphans. This led to the famous statute
of Anne, introduced in 1709, and passed March, 1710, "for the
encouragement of learning," said to have been drawn in its original form
by Swift, which remains the practical foundation of copyright in England
and America to-day.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<h4>THE DEVELOPMENT OF STATUTORY COPYRIGHT IN ENGLAND</h4>

<p class="p2 sidenote"><a name="24a"></a>The statute of Anne as
foundation</p>

<p>The statute of Anne, the foundation of the present copyright system of
England and America, which took effect April 10, 1710, gave the author of
works then existing, or his assigns, the sole right of printing for
twenty-one years from that date and no longer; of works not then printed,
for fourteen years and no longer, except in case he were alive at the
expiration of that term, when he could have the privilege prolonged for
another fourteen years. Penalties were provided, which could not be
exacted unless the books were registered with the Stationers' Company, and
which must be sued for within three months after the offence. If too high
prices were charged, the Queen's officers might order them lowered. A book
could not be imported without written consent of the owner of the printing
right. The number of deposit copies was increased to nine. The act was not
to prejudice any previous rights of the universities and others.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="24b"></a>Its relations to common law<br />

<a name="25a"></a>The crucial cases</p>

<p>This act did not touch the question of rights at common law, and soon
after its statutory term of protection on previously printed books
expired, in 1731, lawsuits began. The first was that of Eyre <i>v.</i>
Walker, in which Sir Joseph Jekyll granted, in 1735, an injunction as to
"The whole duty of man," which had been first published in 1657, or
seventy-eight years before. In this and several other cases the Court of
Chancery issued injunctions on the theory that the legal right was
unquestioned. But in 1769 the famous <a name="Page_25"
id="Page_25"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 25]</span>case of Millar
<i>v.</i> Taylor, as to the copyright of Thomson's "Seasons," brought
directly before the Court of King's Bench the question whether rights at
common law still existed, aside from the statute and its period of
protection. In this case Lord Mansfield and two other judges held that an
author had, at common law, a perpetual copyright, independent of statute,
one dissenting justice holding that there was no such property at common
law. The copyright was sold by Millar's executors to Becket, who
prosecuted Donaldson for piracy and obtained from Lord Chancellor Bathurst
a perpetual injunction. In 1774, in the famous case of Donaldson <i>v.</i>
Becket, this decision was appealed from, and the issue was carried to the
highest tribunal, the House of Lords.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="25b"></a>The Judges' opinions</p>

<p>The House of Lords propounded five questions to the judges. These, with
the replies,<a name= "fnanchor_1" id= "fnanchor_1"></a><a href=
"#footnote_1" class= "fnanchor">[1]</a> were as follows:</p>

<p>I. Whether, at common law, an author of any book or literary
composition had the sole right of first printing and publishing the same
for sale; and might bring an action against any person who printed,
published and sold the same without his consent? Yes, 10 to 1 that he had
the sole right, etc.,&mdash;and 8 to 3 that he might bring the action.</p>

<p>II. If the author had such right originally, did the law take it away,
upon his printing and publishing such book or literary composition; and
might any person afterward reprint and sell, for his own benefit, such
book or literary composition against the will of the author? No, 7 to
4.</p>

<p>III. If such action would have lain at common law, is it taken away by
the statute of 8th Anne? And is <a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 26]</span>an author, by the said statute, precluded
from every remedy, except on the foundation of the said statute and on the
terms and conditions prescribed thereby? Yes, 6 to 5.</p>

<p>IV. Whether the author of any literary composition and his assigns had
the sole right of printing and publishing the same in perpetuity, by the
common law? Yes, 7 to 4.</p>

<p>V. Whether this right is any way impeached, restrained, or taken away
by the statute of 8th Anne? Yes, 6 to 5.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="26a"></a>The Lords' decision</p>

<p>These opinions, that there was perpetual copyright at common law, which
was not lost by publication, but that the statute of Anne took away that
right and confined remedies to the statutory provisions, were directly
contrary to the previous decrees of the courts, and on a motion seconded
by the Lord Chancellor, the House of Lords, 22 to 11, reversed the decree
in the case at issue. This construction by the Lords, in the case of
Donaldson <i>v.</i> Becket, of the statute of Anne, has practically "laid
down the law" for England and America ever since.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="26b"></a>Protests</p>

<p>Two protests against this action deserve note. The first, that of the
universities, was met by an act of 1775, which granted to the English and
Scotch universities (to which Dublin was added in 1801), and to the
colleges of Eton, Westminster and Winchester, perpetual copyright in works
bequeathed to and printed by them. The other, that of the booksellers,
presented to the Commons February 28, 1774, set forth that the petitioners
had invested large sums in the belief of perpetuity of copyright, but a
bill for their relief was rejected.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="26c"></a>Supplementary legislation</p>

<p>In 1801 an act was passed authorizing suits for damages [at common law,
as well as penalties under statute] during the period of protection of the
statute, <a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
27]</span>the need for such a law having been shown in the case of
Beckford <i>v.</i> Hood in 1798, wherein the court had to "stretch a
point" to protect the plaintiff's rights in an anonymous book, which he
had not entered in the Stationers' register.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="27"></a>The Georgian period</p>

<p>Meantime, during the Georgian period, there had been much incidental
copyright legislation. The provision in the statute of Anne for the
limitation of prices was repealed by the act of 1739, which also continued
the prohibition of the importation of foreign reprints, further continued
in later acts or customs regulations from time to time, until these were
disposed of by the statute law revision act of 1867. Copyright had been
extended to engravings and prints by successive acts of 1734-5 (8 George
II, c. 13), 1766-7 (7 George III, c. 38) and 1777 (17 George III, c. 57);
to designs for linen and cotton printing by acts of 1787, 1789 and 1794;
to sculpture by acts of 1798 and 1814 (54 George III, c. 56). A private
copyright act of 1734 granted to Samuel Buckley, a citizen and stationer
of London, sole liberty of printing an improved edition of the histories
of Thuanus, and the engravings act of 1767 contained a similar special
provision for the widow of Hogarth. In 1814 also, copyright in books was
extended to twenty-eight years and the remainder of life, and the author
was relieved from delivering the eleven library copies then required,
except on demand. The university copyright act of 1775 (15 George III, c.
53), above-mentioned, and the other acts given with specific citation
above, still constitute, in certain unrepealed provisions, a part of the
English law, although others of their provisions and other laws were
repealed by later copyright acts or by the statute law revision act of
1861 or that of 1867.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="28a"></a>Legislation under William IV</p>

<p>In the reign of William IV the dramatic copyright act of 1833 (3
William IV, c. 15) became, and in part <a name="Page_28"
id="Page_28"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 28]</span>remains, the basis of
copyright in drama. The lectures copyright act of 1835 (5 &amp; 6 William
IV, c. 65) for the first time covered that field. In 1836 the prints and
engravings copyright (Ireland) act (6 &amp; 7 William IV, c. 59) extended
protection to those classes in that country, and another copyright act (6
&amp; 7 William IV, c. 110) reduced the number of library copies required
to five. These laws also remain in force, in unrepealed provisions, as a
part of British copyright law.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="28b"></a>The Victorian act of 1842</p>

<p>In 1841, under the leadership of Serjeant Talfourd, author of "Ion" and
other dramatic works, a new copyright bill was presented to the House of
Commons, in the preparation of which George Palmer Putnam, the American
publisher, then resident in London, had been consulted. It provided for
compulsory registration and extended the term to life and thirty years.
The bill attracted little attention and met with no opposition until the
second reading, when Lord Macaulay, a bachelor, interested in fame rather
than profit to an author or his descendants, attacked the bill and "the
great debate" ensued. Macaulay offered a bill limiting copyright to the
life of the author, but finally assented to a compromise, by which the
term was made forty-two years or the life of the author and seven years,
whichever the longer. The resulting copyright act of 1842 (5 &amp; 6
Victoria, c. 45) presented a new code of copyright, covering the ground of
previous laws, but not in terms repealing them. As a result, provisions
not specifically repealed or superseded remained in force, and the act of
1842, though serving since as the basic act, has had to be construed with
the previous acts in view. The bill practically preserved, however, the
restrictions of the statute of Anne. The term of forty-two years or life
and seven years is applied to articles in periodicals, but <a
name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 29]</span>the
right in these reverts to the author after twenty-eight years. The
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council may authorize the publication of a
work which after the author's death the proprietor of the copyright
refuses to republish.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="29a"></a>Protection of designs</p>

<p>In the same year, 1842, there was passed also a copyright in designs
act, covering designs for articles of manufacture, consolidating previous
laws on this specific subject from 1787 to 1839 (two bills in this last
year having extended protection to printing designs for woolen and other
fabrics and to articles of manufacture generally), and providing for a
registrar for such designs,&mdash;in which act the careless use of the
word "ornamenting" seemed so to limit the scope that an amendatory act was
passed in 1843.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="29b"></a>Subsequent acts</p>

<p>An international copyright act, introduced in the first year of the
Victorian reign, had been passed in 1838, to protect foreign books
reprinted in England, but it proved inadequate and was repealed by the
subsequent act of 1844 (7 &amp; 8 Victoria, c. 12), providing more
comprehensively for international copyright, on the basis of registration
and deposit in London. The colonial copyright act of 1847 (10 &amp; 11
Victoria, c. 95) authorized copyright legislation by any colony, subject
to the approval of the Crown, and the suspension for such colony of the
prohibition of foreign reprints, which act is therefore often cited as the
foreign reprints act. An act of 1850 further covered designs and provided
for their provisional registration, and one in 1851 protected exhibits at
the international exhibition of that year in London. A third international
copyright act was passed in 1852 (15 &amp; 16 Victoria, c. 12) covering
translations and including an authorization of a special treaty with
France. The fine arts copyright act of 1862 (25 &amp; 26 Victoria, c. 68)
extended copyright to paintings, drawings, and <a name="Page_30"
id="Page_30"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 30]</span>photographs, hitherto
unprotected, for life and seven years. A fourth international copyright
act of 1875 (38 &amp; 39 Victoria, c. 12) protected foreign dramatic works
from imitation or adaptation on the English stage, which had been
specifically permitted by the previous law, and in the same year "The
Canada copyright act" (38 &amp; 39 Victoria, c. 53) gave effect to a
Canadian parliament act respecting copyright reprints.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="30"></a>The Royal Commission report of
1878</p>

<p>"The law of England, as to copyright," says the report of the Royal
Copyright Commission, in a blue-book of 1878, "consists partly of the
provisions of fourteen Acts of Parliament, which relate in whole or in
part to different branches of the subject, and partly of common law
principles, nowhere stated in any definite or authoritative way, but
implied in a considerable number of reported cases scattered over the law
reports." The digest, by Sir James Stephen, appended to this report, is
presented by the Commission as "a correct statement of the law as it
stands." This digest is one of the most valuable contributions to the
literature of copyright, but the frequency with which such phrases occur
as "it is probable, but not certain," "it is uncertain," "probably," "it
seems," shows the state of the law, "wholly destitute of any sort of
arrangement, incomplete, often obscure," as says the report itself. The
digest is accompanied, in parallel columns, with alterations suggested by
the Commission, and it is much to be regretted that their work failed to
reach the expected result of an act of Parliament. The evidence taken by
the Commission forms a second blue-book, also of great value.</p>

<p>This report and digest covered legislation through 1875, inclusive of
the Canada act. They seem also to have regarded, though the act is not
specified in the schedule, the consolidated customs act of 1876 (39 &amp;
40 Victoria, c. 36), which incidentally contained the <a name="Page_31"
id="Page_31"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 31]</span>provisions for the
prohibition of the importation of copyright books.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="31a"></a>Later legislation</p>

<p>Despite the recommendations of the Commission and several later
endeavors to pass a comprehensive copyright act,&mdash;of which the most
important was Lord Monkswell's bill introduced into Parliament on behalf
of the British Society of Authors, November 16, 1890, and given in full
with an analysis by Walter Besant in George Haven Putnam's "Question of
copyright"&mdash;later legislation in England has been confined
practically to two topics, international copyright and the vexed question
of musical compositions.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="31b"></a>International copyright</p>

<p>The international copyright act of 1886 (49 &amp; 50 Victoria, c. 43),
amending and extending, and in part repealing the earlier international
copyright acts and provisions, was intended to enable Great Britain,
through Orders in Council, to become a party to international agreements,
particularly the Berne copyright convention of 1886, ratified in 1887;
this was made effective with respect to the eight other countries which
were parties to the original Berne convention by the Order in Council of
November 28, 1887, taking effect December 6, 1887. The convention was to
extend to the British possessions, though with exceptions in some
respects. The revenue act of 1889 (52 &amp; 53 Victoria, c. 42) extended
the prohibition of importation to foreign works copyrighted under the act
of 1886, "printed or reprinted in any country or state" other than that
"in which they were first published," if registered as required by the
customs authorities.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="31c"></a>Musical copyright</p>

<p>The protection of musical compositions was in such confused and
unsatisfactory condition that special legislation was necessary. The
recent laws on this subject, described in detail in the chapter on
dramatic and musical copyright, include the copyright (musical <a
name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
32]</span>compositions) act of 1882 (45 &amp; 46 Victoria, c. 40); the
copyright (musical compositions) act of 1888 (51 &amp; 52 Victoria, c.
17); the musical (summary proceedings) copyright act of 1902 (2 Edward
VII, c. 15); and the musical copyright act of 1906 (6 Edward VII, c.
36),&mdash;following the report of the Musical Copyright Committee of
1904,&mdash;which successively met imperfections developed in applying the
previous law.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="32a"></a>Committee report of 1909</p>

<p>After the adoption of the revised international copyright convention
signed at Berlin November 13, 1908, modifying the Berne-Paris conventions,
a Committee on the law of copyright consisting of seventeen publicists,
authors, artists, publishers and others was appointed by minute of March
9, 1909, by the President of the Board of Trade, to consider and report
upon the modification of domestic legislation in conformity with the
Berlin agreement of 1908. The Committee made a report in December, 1909,
strongly advising that domestic legislation be brought into line with
international practice and that the copyright term in Great Britain be for
life and fifty years. With the report was printed a blue-book of minutes
of evidence, containing valuable appendixes which included a <i>projêt de
loi type</i> (model bill) on copyright, drafted by the International
Literary and Artistic Association, and an artistic copyright bill drafted
by the Artistic Copyright Society.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Imperial copyright conference of 1909</p>

<p>In the early part of 1909 an Imperial copyright conference was also
held in London, attended by Crown officials and representatives from all
of the self-governing dominions, at which certain resolutions for
copyright betterment were adopted. Its minutes and resolutions were also
presented to Parliament.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="32b"></a>The pending bill</p>

<p>As a result of the deliberations and reports of these two bodies, "a
bill to amend and consolidate the law relating to copyright" (1 George V)
was introduced <a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 33]</span>into the House of Commons July 26, 1910, in
the names of Mr. Buxton, Mr. Solicitor-General, Colonel Seely and Mr.
Tennant, the adoption of which would provide a copyright code similar in
extent to the American code of 1909, and applicable throughout the British
dominions, with the proviso that the self-governing dominions may accept
or modify the code or legislate separately, and providing also for
international copyright. The bill adopted most of the features of the
Berlin convention including the term of life and fifty years, covered
literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works, including architectural
works of art, and while distinguishing between first publication and
performance, included under copyright acoustic or visual performance or
exhibition and control for mechanical reproduction. The bill, somewhat
modified, was reintroduced into the subsequent Parliament March 30, 1911,
emerged from committee with important alterations July 13, 1911, and was
passed with slight additional changes by the House of Commons August 17,
and first read in the House of Lords August 18, 1911. On passage of the
House of Lords, it becomes effective July 1, 1912, unless earlier date is
provided by Order in Council. The bill repeals by specific schedule all
existing laws except specified sections in the fine arts copyright act of
1862, the musical copyright acts of 1902 and 1906, and the copyright
provisions in the customs consolidation act of 1876 and the revenue act of
1889. The provisions of the new measure are specifically treated and
summarized comprehensively in later chapters and the full text is given in
the appendix.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="33"></a>Design patents</p>

<p>The bill does not, however, repeal the previous law as to copyright in
designs, which had continued to receive consideration during the Victorian
reign in laws, later than those cited, of 1858-1861, and thus <a
name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
34]</span>finally became merged in the protection of patents. Thus
"designs capable of being registered under the patents and designs act,
1907," are specifically excepted under clause 22 of the proposed copyright
code.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="34"></a>Common law rights</p>

<p>It seems possible that, under the precedent of the acts of 1775 and
1801, the common law rights practically taken away by the statute of Anne
and specifically abrogated by the proposed bill, could have been restored
by legislation. These restrictions have not only ruled the practice of
England ever since, but they were embodied in the Constitution of the
United States, and have influenced alike our legislators and our courts.</p>

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_1" id="footnote_1"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_1">[1]</a> The votes on these decisions are given
differently in the several copyright authorities. These figures are
corrected from 4 Burrow's Reports, 2408, the leading English parliamentary
reports, and are probably right.</p>

<h3 class="p4">IV</h3>

<h4>THE HISTORY OF COPYRIGHT IN THE UNITED STATES</h4>

<p class="p2 sidenote"><a name="35a"></a>Constitutional provision</p>

<p>The Constitution of the United States authorized Congress "to promote
the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times, to
authors and inventors, the exclusive right to their respective writings
and discoveries." Previous to its adoption, in 1787, the nation had no
power to act, but on Madison's motion, Congress, in May, 1783, recommended
the States to pass acts securing copyright for fourteen years.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="35b"></a>Early state legislation</p>

<p>Connecticut in January, 1783, Massachusetts in March, 1783, and
Maryland in April, 1783, had already provided for copyright, twenty-one
years being the usual period. New Jersey on May 27, 1783, and New
Hampshire and Rhode Island in December of the same year, followed
Madison's suggestion. Pennsylvania and South Carolina in March, 1784,
Virginia and North Carolina in 1785, Georgia and New York in 1786, also
passed copyright acts, so that all the thirteen States except Vermont had
separately provided for copyright,&mdash;thanks to the vigorous copyright
crusade of Noah Webster, who traveled from capital to capital,&mdash;when
the United States statute of 1790 made them unnecessary.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="35c"></a>The act of 1790</p>

<p>This act followed the precedent of the English act of 1710, and gave to
authors who were citizens or residents, their heirs and assigns, copyright
in books, maps and charts for fourteen years, with renewal for fourteen
years more, if the author were living at expiration of the first term. A
printed title must be deposited before publication in the clerk's office
of <a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
36]</span>the local United States District Court; notice must be printed
four times in a newspaper within two months after publication; a copy must
be deposited with the United States Secretary of State within six months
after publication; the penalties were forfeiture and a fine of fifty cents
for each sheet found, half to go to the United States; a remedy was
provided against unauthorized publication of manuscripts.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="36"></a>1802-1867<br />

<a name="37a"></a>The revised act of 1870<br />

<a name="37b"></a>1874-1882</p>

<p>This original and fundamental act was followed by others&mdash;in 1802,
requiring copyright record to be printed on or next the title-page, and
including designs, engravings and etchings; in 1819, giving United States
Circuit Courts original jurisdiction in copyright cases; in 1831 (a
consolidation of previous acts), including musical compositions, extending
the term to twenty-eight years, with renewal for fourteen years to author,
widow, or children, doing away with the newspaper notice except for
renewals, and providing for the deposit of a copy with the district clerk
(for transmission to the Secretary of State) within three months after
publication; in 1834, requiring record of assignment in the court of
original entry; in 1846 (the act establishing the Smithsonian
Institution), requiring one copy to be delivered to that, and one to the
Library of Congress; in 1855, a postal provision for free mailing of
deposits; in 1856, securing to dramatists the right of performance; in
1859, repealing the provision of 1846 for the deposit of copies, and
making the Interior Department instead of the State Department the
copyright custodian; in 1861, providing for appeal in all copyright cases
to the Supreme Court; in 1865, including photographs and negatives, and
again requiring deposit with the Library of Congress, within one month
from publication; in 1867, providing $25 penalty for failure to deposit.
This makes twelve acts bearing on copyright up to 1870, <a name="Page_37"
id="Page_37"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 37]</span>when a general act
took the place of all, including "paintings, drawings, chromos, statues,
statuary, and models or designs intended to be perfected as works of the
fine arts." This did away with the local District Court system of
registry, and made the Librarian of Congress the copyright officer, with
whom printed title must be filed before, and two copies deposited within
ten days after, publication. In 1873-4 the copyright act was included in
the Revised Statutes as sections 4948 to 4971 (also see secs. 629 and
699), and in 1874 an amendatory act made legal a short form of record,
"Copyright, 18__, by A. B.," and relegated labels to the Patent Office.
In 1879 the Post Office appropriation bill contained a proviso against the
transmission of any publication which violates copyright; in 1882 an
amendment dealt with the position of the copyright notice on moulded,
decorative articles, etc.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="37c"></a>International copyright legislation,
1891</p>

<p>In 1891 there was passed, after a long campaign, the so-called
international copyright act, extending copyright to the citizens of other
nations in case of reciprocal grants by such nations, and providing that
the copyright on books and certain other articles should be conditioned on
manufacture in the United States. In 1893 an amendatory act gave the same
effect to copies deposited "on or before publication." In 1895 the public
documents bill provided that no government publication should be
copyrighted, and another bill imposed penalties in the case of
infringement of photographs and of original works of art. In 1897 an act
provided that unauthorized representation, wilful and for profit, of any
dramatic or musical composition is a misdemeanor punishable by
imprisonment; another act provided for the appointment of a Register of
Copyrights under the direction and supervision of the Librarian of
Congress; and a <a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 38]</span>third act provided penalty for printing
false claim of copyright and prohibited the importation of articles
bearing a false claim of copyright. In 1904 provision was made for
protection to exhibitors of foreign literary, artistic or musical works at
the Louisiana Purchase Exposition. A bill of 1905 permitted <i>ad
interim</i> copyright for one year of books published abroad if registered
here within thirty days publication and bearing notice of reservation.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="38a"></a>Private copyright acts</p>

<p>A curious incident in American copyright legislation has been the
passage of private copyright acts, nine in all, of which the earliest in
1828, as amended in 1830 and 1843, continued the copyright of John Rowlett
"in a useful book, called Rowlett's Tables of discount and interest" from
its original publication in 1802 till 1858,&mdash;curiously the present
period of fifty-six years. In 1849 the copyright of Levi H. Corson in a
perpetual calendar or almanac was renewed by special act. In 1854 an
appropriation of $10,000 was made to Thomas H. Sumner for his new method
of ascertaining a ship's position and the copyright was extinguished. In
1859 a special act gave to "Mistress Henry R. Schoolcraft" and her heirs
for fourteen years the right to republish her husband's work on the Indian
tribes originally published by order of Congress and to make any
abridgement thereof, and a similar special copyright was voted in 1866 for
Herndon's "Exploration of the Amazon" for his widow. An act of 1874
authorized the validation of William Tod Helmuth's work on surgery which
had been imperfectly entered for copyright two years before, and a ninth
private act in 1898 validated for like reason the copyright of Judson
Jones in a work on orthoepy.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="38b"></a>American possessions</p>

<p>In 1900 the act for the government of the territory of Hawaii repealed
the Hawaiian copyright act of 1888 and extended United States copyright to
Hawaii. <a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
39]</span>In the same year the act providing temporary government for
Porto Rico extended the copyright laws to that island. In 1904 the
Attorney General rendered an opinion that Philippine authors were entitled
to United States copyright but that the book must be manufactured within
the United States. Hawaii, Porto Rico and the Philippine Islands, as well
as Alaska, were later included by name in the jurisdiction of the code of
1909. American copyright was extended to the Canal Zone by War Department
order in 1907.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="39a"></a>The American code of 1909</p>

<p>Finally, in 1909, there was passed the new copyright code repealing all
previous legislation and providing comprehensively for the whole subject
of copyright, literary, artistic, dramatic, musical, or other. Under this
code copyright is effected by publication with the statutory notice of
copyright and completed by registration of two deposit copies sent to the
Copyright Office promptly after publication. The manufacturing clause is
continued and extended to require printing and binding as well as
type-setting within the United States. The musical author is given control
over mechanical reproductions though under provision for compulsory
license in case he permits any such reproduction. The copyright term is
for twenty-eight years with a like renewal term, making fifty-six years.
Rights of performance are included under copyright, and unpublished works
are specifically protected by special registration. These are the salient
features of the code which is stated and discussed in detail in succeeding
chapters.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="39b"></a>State protection of playright</p>

<p>In line with the dramatic act of 1897, the dramatic authors between
1895 and 1905 procured state legislation in the States of New Hampshire,

<p class="sidenote"><a name="40b"></a>Common law relations</p>

<p>The act of 1790 received an interpretation, in 1834, in the case of
Wheaton <i>v.</i> Peters (rival law reports), at the bar of the U.&nbsp;S.
Supreme Court, which placed copyright in the United States exactly in the
<i>status</i> it held in England after the decision of the House of Lords
in 1774. The court referred directly to that decision as the ruling
precedent, and declared that by the statute of 1790 Congress did not
affirm an existing right, but created a right. It stated also that there
was no common law of the United States and that (English) common law as to
copyright had not been adopted in Pennsylvania, where the case arose. So
late as 1880, in Putnam <i>v.</i> Pollard, claim was made that this ruling
decision did not apply in New York, <a name="Page_41"
id="Page_41"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 41]</span>which, in its statute
of 1786, expressly "provided, that nothing in this act shall extend to,
affect, prejudice, or confirm the rights which any person may have to the
printing or publishing of any books or pamphlets at common law, in cases
not mentioned in this act." But the N. Y. Supreme Court decided that the
precedent of Wheaton <i>v.</i> Peters nevertheless held. During the
discussion of the present copyright code, Edward Everett Hale consulted
with other veteran authors whose early works were passing out of
copyright, with the intention of bringing a test case for the extension of
copyright under common law after the expiration of the statutory period.
But on proposing such a case to legal counsel he became assured that such
a suit could not be maintained.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Divided opinions</p>

<p>As in the English case of Donaldson <i>v.</i> Becket, the decision in
the American ruling case of Wheaton v. Peters came from a divided court.
The opinion was handed down by Justice McLean, three other judges
agreeing, Justices Thompson and Baldwin dissenting, a seventh judge being
absent. The opinions of the dissenting judges, given in Eaton S. Drone's
"A treatise on the law of property in intellectual productions,"
constitute one of the strongest statements ever made of natural rights in
literary property, in opposition to the ruling that the right is solely
the creature of the statute. "An author's right," says Justice Thompson,
"ought to be esteemed an inviolable right established in sound reason and
abstract morality." There seems, indeed, to be a sense of natural
copyright among the American Indians; an Ojibwa brave will not sing the
song belonging to another tribe or singer, and a Chippewa youth may learn
his father's songs, on a customary gift of tobacco, but does not inherit
the right to sing them.</p>

<h4>SCOPE OF COPYRIGHT: RIGHTS AND EXTENT</h4>

<p class="p2 sidenote"><a name="42a"></a>General scope</p>

<p>The scope of copyright, or the nature and extent of the right or
privilege, may be said to cover at common law identical rights with those
in any other property, to use the phrase which, in Siam, transfers these
rights to statutory law, but in statutory law must be taken to depend upon
the terms of the statute.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="42b"></a>American provisions</p>

<p>The new American copyright code, passed March 4, 1909, and in force
July 1, 1909, in its fundamental provision broadly sets forth and
specifically defines the scope of copyright, by providing (sec. 1): "That
any person entitled thereto, upon complying with the provisions of this
Act, shall have the exclusive right:</p>

<p>"(a) To print, reprint, publish, copy, and vend the copyrighted
work;</p>

<p>"(b) To translate the copyrighted work into other languages or
dialects, or make any other version thereof, if it be a literary work; to
dramatize it if it be a non-dramatic work; to convert it into a novel or
other non-dramatic work if it be a drama; to arrange or adapt it if it be
a musical work; to complete, execute, and finish it if it be a model or
design for a work of art;</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="42c"></a>Oral addresses</p>

<p>"(c) To deliver or authorize the delivery of the copyrighted work in
public for profit if it be a lecture, sermon, address, or similar
production;</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="42d"></a>Dramas</p>

<p>"(d) To perform or represent the copyrighted work publicly if it be a
drama, or, if it be a dramatic work and not reproduced in copies for sale,
to vend any manuscript or any record whatsoever thereof; to make or to
procure the making of any transcription <a name="Page_43"
id="Page_43"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 43]</span>or record thereof by
or from which, in whole or in part, it may in any manner or by any method
be exhibited, performed, represented, produced, or reproduced; and to
exhibit, perform, represent, produce, or reproduce it in any manner or by
any method whatsoever;</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="43a"></a>Music</p>

<p>"(e) To perform the copyrighted work publicly for profit if it be a
musical composition and for the purpose of public performance for profit;
and for the purposes set forth in subsection (a) hereof, to make any
arrangement or setting of it or of the melody of it in any system of
notation or any form of record in which the thought of an author may be
recorded and from which it may be read or reproduced"&mdash;which last
clause is, however, limited by an elaborate proviso requiring the
licensing of mechanical musical reproductions in case the copyright
proprietor permits any reproduction by that means, which proviso is given
in full in the chapter on mechanical music.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="43b"></a>Previous American law</p>

<p>The American law previously defined the scope of copyright (Rev. Stat.
sec. 4952), as "the sole liberty of printing, reprinting, publishing,
completing, copying, executing, finishing, and vending the same; and, in
the case of a dramatic composition, of publicly performing or representing
it, or causing it to be performed or represented by others. And authors
may reserve the right to dramatize or to translate their own works." The
new code is both broader and more definite.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="43c"></a>Unpublished works</p>

<p>The new American code is specific in preserving to an author previous
to the publication of his work all common law rights in the comprehensive
language (sec. 2): "That nothing in this Act shall be construed to annul
or limit the right of the author or proprietor of an unpublished work, at
common law or in equity, to prevent the copying, publication, or use of
such <a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
44]</span>unpublished work without his consent, and to obtain damages
therefor."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="44a"></a>Common law scope</p>

<p>In the Washburn form of the copyright bill it was proposed to include a
clause to the effect "that subject to the limitations and conditions of
this Act copyright secured hereunder shall be entitled to all the rights
and remedies which would be accorded to any other species of property at
common law." But this provision was not accepted by the Congressional
Committees and does not form part of the copyright code as enacted.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="44b"></a>Common law in U.&nbsp;S.
practice</p>

<p>The common law of England became the common law of its colonies and
finally of the sovereign States of the United States, and common law is
therefore administered by the state rather than by the federal courts. In
the case of Wheaton <i>v.</i> Peters, the U.&nbsp;S. Supreme Court went so
far as to say "there is no common law of the United States," but federal
courts accept and apply in each State the common law as accepted in that
State, and in later years the U.&nbsp;S. Supreme Court has held, as in
1901, in Western Union Tel. Co. <i>v.</i> Call Pub. Co., that where there
is a conflict between the common law as accepted by different States or
where the rule adopted is not in accord with federal courts, the United
States courts will recognize and enforce the common law of England. This
use by the federal courts, as here pointed out by Justice Brewer, is
peculiarly applicable to interstate transactions. The effect of section 2
of the copyright code is to give the federal courts the special authority
of Congress to accept and enforce the principles of common law and of
equity in the case of unpublished works.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="44c"></a>Statutory limitations</p>

<p>But in the case of a published work, the courts have denied to
copyright works some of the rights and remedies applicable previous to
publication, because <a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 45]</span>not specifically granted by statute, in
accordance with the established rule that no rights or remedies will be
allowed by the courts unless specifically granted. But the common law
right of the author is recognized by the courts notwithstanding the
publication of his work, if that is done without the author's consent. In
1896, in the case of Press Pub. Co. <i>v.</i> Monroe, the doctrine was
specifically held by the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court of Appeals through Judge
Lacombe, that the unauthorized publisher may be restrained and damages
obtained by civil action, and recovery in such an action will not divest
the author of any of his rights or invest any of his rights in the
infringer or the public.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="45"></a>General rights</p>

<p>Thus the owner of a copyrightable work may (before publication), as
with other personal property, preserve his work exclusively for his own
use, or he may (1) print, (2) reprint, (3) publish, (4) copy, or (5) vend
it; or</p>

<p>If it be a literary work he may (6) translate it, or (7) make any other
version thereof, or (8) dramatize it; or</p>

<p>If a work for oral delivery he may (9) deliver or authorize delivery in
public for profit; or</p>

<p>If it be a dramatic work he may (10) convert it into a novel or other
non-dramatic form or (11) perform or represent it, or (as in 5) vend any
manuscript or record thereof, or (12) make or cause to be made any
transcription or record thereof; or (13) exhibit, perform, produce, or
reproduce it in any manner or by any method; or</p>

<p>If it be a musical work he may (14) arrange or (15) adapt it, or (as in
11) perform it publicly for profit, or (16) make any arrangement or (17)
setting of the melody in any notation or by any form of record (the last
subject to the license provision of the statute); or</p>

<p><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 46]</span> If
a design for a work of art, he may (18) complete, execute, and finish
it,</p>

<p>&mdash;all these being specifically reserved and granted to the author,
although in somewhat complex and overlapping phraseology, by the new
American code.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="46a"></a>Inferential rights</p>

<p>Or, in utilizing his rights at common law or as above granted by
statute, he may (19) give, (20) lend, (21) grant, (22) sell, (23)
manufacture, (24) lease or license, (25) mortgage, or (26) devise his work
or the use of it, or (27) it may pass by inheritance,&mdash;as pointed out
by Arthur Steuart, chairman of the Copyright Committee of the American Bar
Association, in his argument before the Congressional Committees.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="46b"></a>Differentiated rights</p>

<p>Or, as also pointed out by Mr. Steuart, he may "impose upon any of
these estates any condition or limit," as by limiting the use (28) for
special purposes, (29) at a special price, or (30) for a special time, or
(31) in a special locality, or (32) to a special person.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="46c"></a>Court protection</p>

<p>The rights scheduled, adds Mr. Steuart, the courts will protect (a) "in
equity by injunction and the recovery of profits"; or (b) "at law by a
civil action for trespass or conversion, with a recovery of special
damages for actual injury or punitive damages for injury to reputation, or
by replevin for the recovery of possession of the work, as well as by any
other form of action known to the common law or statute law and proper to
the protection of this class of property."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="46d"></a>Division of rights</p>

<p>The owner of the copyright of a book may thus publish a limited edition
of his book and sell it to whom he may please, or for a specified market.
Such specified or divided rights are recognized in Germany as
"<i>getheiltes Verlagsrecht</i>," in France as "<i>édition partagée</i>,"
and there is specific reference to them in the German copyright law. Some
of the specified rights are cognate to the rights of a proprietor of land
to sell a piece of land subject to certain restrictions, <a name="Page_47"
id="Page_47"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 47]</span>agreed upon with the
purchaser or imposed upon the title in the deed of transfer. As in the
frequent practice of restricting use for the purposes of a stable or a
shop, or requiring that only one house shall be built on a specified
number of lots.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="47"></a>Analysis of property rights</p>

<p>In an elaborate discussion of fundamental principles in his opinion in
Harper <i>v.</i> Donohue, in 1905, affirmed by the Circuit Court of
Appeals in 1906, Judge Sanborn analyzed the property rights of an author
before publication, after unrestricted publication and after publication
under the copyright acts. Among the rights before publication he mentions
"the right to sell and assign the author's interest, either absolutely or
conditionally, with or without qualification, limitation or restriction,
territorial or otherwise, by oral or written transfer. Such literary
property is not subject either to execution or taxation, because this
might include a forced sale, the very thing the owner has the right to
prevent." "Unrestricted publication," he says, "without copyright, is a
transfer to the public to do most of the things the author might do, in
common with the author, except all right of transfer and sale, which
remains to the author; but without advantage, since the work has become,
by the publication, common property." "The copyright acts," he concludes,
"substantially give the following additional rights: To copyright, and
thus secure the sole privilege of unlimited multiplication and sale of
copies; to sell or transfer the unlimited right of reproduction, sale and
publication, the limited right of serial publication, the right of
publication in book form, the right of translation, the right of
dramatization or one or more of these rights in specific territory, and
the right to secure a copyright either generally, or in one or more
countries whose laws permit it, either in the name of the author <a
name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 48]</span>or
assignee. Also the right to the author to license the sale or other
restricted enjoyment of some lesser right, without the power to
copyright."</p>

<p>The courts have indeed held to very broad principles as to such rights.
In the case of Press Pub. Co. <i>v.</i> Monroe, the court said:</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="48a"></a>Broad interpretation</p>

<p>"The right of property includes the right to transfer the subject of it
or any interest in it by gift, grant, or device. And if the fruits of
mental effort are regarded as property, like all other possessions, they
descend to the legatees, the executors, and administrators of their
creditors; they pass by sale or gift to their transferees; the use of
them, limited or unlimited, goes to their licensees, and, logically, the
power of the State is bound to protect forever the successive owners in
the exclusive use and enjoyment thereof."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="48b"></a>Limits of protection</p>

<p>Where these latter rights are not specifically granted by statute, the
rule has been established by the courts that they will be upheld so far as
necessarily inferable from the rights granted and not further. It is under
this rule that the greater number of the mooted questions in the
application of copyright law have arisen in respect to the scope of
copyright. Most of these specific rights are in fact necessary inferences
from the statute, in the protection of the property rights therein
conferred, but the courts will not go beyond fair construction of the
letter of the statute.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="48c"></a>Differentiated contracts</p>

<p>In respect to the rights to give, lend, grant, manufacture, lease or
license, mortgage or devise copyright property, it may be said that these
are subsidiary rights conditioned on and essential to the general right of
property in copyrightable or copyrighted material. An author may exercise
any of these rights in respect to his unpublished work so far as they are
applicable to it, or to his copyrighted work after publication; and either
the copyrightable manuscript or <a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 49]</span>the copyrighted work may pass by
inheritance. Thus an author may manufacture, or cause to be manufactured,
his unpublished work, and he may retain exclusive control over the
manufactured copies so long as he pleases before publishing the work; and
after publication (which involves placing on public sale, or publicly
distributing) he may exercise these rights negatively by withdrawing his
work from further sale. The English law, however, contains a provision
that in certain cases the Crown may require continuance of
publication.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="49"></a>Enforcement in limited grants</p>

<p>In respect to the right to limit the use of his work under his sale,
gift, loan, grant, lease, etc., for a special purpose or at a special
price, or for a special time, or in a special locality or to a special
person, these powers of limitation, though implied in the grant of
copyright, are dependent for their enforcement rather upon the law of
contracts than upon copyright law.</p>

<p>There can be no such thing as a copyright for a special purpose or for
a special locality, or under other special conditions, for there can be
only one copyright, and that a general copyright, in any one work. But
specific contracts can be made, enforceable under the law of contracts, as
for the sale of a copyrighted book within a certain territory, provided
such contracts or limitations are not contrary to other laws. Although
record of assignment in the Copyright Office is provided for by the law
only for the copyright in general, the separate estates as a right to
publish in a periodical and the right to publish as a book may be sold and
assigned separately, and the special assignment recorded in the Copyright
Office, though this does not convey a right to substitute in the copyright
notice a name other than that of the recorded proprietor of the general
copyright, which can only be changed as <a name="Page_50"
id="Page_50"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 50]</span>specifically provided
in the law under recorded assignment of the entire copyright.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="50"></a>Copyright as monopoly</p>

<p>Copyright is a monopoly to which the government assures protection in
granting the copyright. It is a monopoly not in the offensive sense, but
in the sense of private and personal ownership; the public is not the
loser but is the gainer by the protection and encouragement given to the
author. The whole aim of copyright protection is to permit the author to
sell as he pleases and to transfer his rights collectively or severally to
such assigns as he may choose. Copyright is a monopoly only in the sense
that any ownership is a monopoly. Says Herbert Spencer: "If I am a
monopolist, so also are you; so also is every man. If I have no right to
those products of my brain, neither have you to those of your hands. No
one can become the sole owner of any article whatever; and all property is
'robbery.'" In the copyright debates of 1891, Senator O. H. Platt rightly
said: "The very essence of copyright is the privilege of controlling the
market. That is the only way in which a man's property in the work of his
brain can be assured." And as Senator Evarts pointed out in the same
debate: "The sole question is what we shall do concerning something which
is the essential nature of copyright and patent protection, namely,
monopoly." In discussing patent monopoly and the law of contracts in
Victor Talking Machine Co. <i>v.</i> The Fair, the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, through Judge Baker, said, in 1903, that "within his
domain the patentee is czar. The people must take the invention on the
terms he dictates or let it alone for seventeen years." Thus as the
government grants and guarantees the monopoly, it is not to be taken as in
restraint of trade or otherwise contrary to law. Said Judge Cullen in the
case of Murphy <i>v.</i> Christian Press Association, in the Appellate
Division of the <a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 51]</span>N. Y. Supreme Court, in 1899, decisions as
to agreements in restraint of trade "have no application to agreements
concerning copyrights and patents, the very object of which is to give
monopolies."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Limit only in term</p>

<p>Copyright being in essence a monopoly giving to the copyright
proprietor "exclusive rights," as the Constitution provides, the only
limitation upon it should be that indicated in the Constitution which
confines protection to "limited times." The opponents of copyright have
frequently taken the course of falling back upon the plea that in the
interests of the public the author should not have exclusive right to his
writings and to manage his own affairs, but that Congress should prescribe
how he should market his property. This commonly takes shape in the
licensing scheme known in England as the Farrer plan and in America as the
Pearsall-Smith plan, with respect to books; and in the passage of the
"international copyright amendment" of 1891 this plan was made the basis
of attack upon the measure. An analysis of the scheme as presented by R.
Pearsall-Smith of Philadelphia is given by G. H. Putnam, from the book
publisher's point of view, in the "Question of copyright." In the work on
"The law and history of copyright," by Augustine Birrell, a member of the
present British cabinet, this plan is characterized as a "preposterous
scheme." In the case of a book, for instance, a publisher often suggests
to the author the general idea of the book, so that it would be doubly
unjust to permit any other publisher to issue that book on the compulsory
license scheme; and this might hold true, although to less extent, in
other fields of copyright. In any event, the original publisher makes
large investment not only in type-setting, printing, and binding a book,
or in the publishing of any other work, but in advertising and making a <a
name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
52]</span>market, and that a rival publisher should have the benefit of
this market without paying the cost is a violation of the very essence of
property. This scheme, however, is applied, in a limited way and as a
compromise, respecting mechanical music, in the American code of 1909, and
constitutes its most serious defect. There is question, indeed, whether
the compulsory license and fixed price may not be an unconstitutional
provision. This matter is more fully discussed in later chapters.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="52a"></a>Altered theory of copyright</p>

<p>It should be noted that whereas the previous American law required
certain statutory formalities before publication, the new American code
somewhat alters the theory of copyright, and more nearly conforms
statutory with common law, by making publication with notice the initial
copyright act and registration and deposit secondary acts necessary for
the completion of the copyright and its protection under the statute.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="52b"></a>Publishing</p>

<p>The definition of the date of publication (sec. 62) as "the earliest
date when copies of the first authorized edition were placed on sale,
sold, or publicly distributed by the proprietor of the copyright or under
his authority" remedies the vagueness of the previous law and adopts into
the statute court decisions to the effect that acts not by the authority
of the author or proprietor do not constitute publication in the sense of
dedication to the public. In other words, it is made clear that the right
to publish inheres in the author and that he cannot be divested of it
without his consent. This is the fundamental principle of the new law in
the vital matter of protecting the author at the critical point at which
an unpublished work, absolutely his own, becomes a published work, subject
to statute. In this respect the American code of 1909 comes very close to
the acceptance of the right <a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 53]</span>in intellectual property as a natural and
inherent right.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="53a"></a>What constitutes publishing</p>

<p>As to what constitutes publishing, interpretation by the courts based
on previous law will in many respects be applicable to the new code. A
book which has been sold or leased to subscribers on a contract of
restricted use is none the less published, as was set forth in the opinion
by Chief Judge Parker of the N. Y. Court of Appeals in Jewellers'
Mercantile Agency <i>v.</i> Jewellers' Weekly Pub. Co. in 1898, and in the
opinion by Judge Putnam of the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court in Massachusetts
in Ladd <i>v.</i> Oxnard in 1896, both having reference to credit-rating
books leased to subscribers for their individual use.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="53b"></a>"Privately printed" works</p>

<p>Publication depends upon sale or offer to the public, and it is a
question whether the sale or offer of a copyrightable work, as the
proceedings or publications of a society, to the members of that society
only, constitutes publication, to be passed upon by the courts in view of
the specific facts. A work "privately printed" or with the imprint
"printed but not published," given or even sold by the author to his
friends, and not sold generally by his authority, would probably not be
held to be published; but the courts would probably hold that the sale of
a work, though "privately printed," to merely nominal members of a nominal
society, made up of the purchasers of the work, would constitute
publication and, if without copyright notice, dedication.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="53c"></a>Copying</p>

<p>As to the right to copy, this word in the broad sense as interpreted by
the courts, covers the duplicating or multiplying of copies within the
stated scope of the statute. It was argued in the mechanical music cases
that the word copy extends to any form or method of duplication by which
the thought of the author can be recorded or conveyed, but, as more fully
stated in <a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
54]</span>the chapter on mechanical music, the U.&nbsp;S. Supreme Court in
White-Smith <i>v.</i> Apollo Co. in 1908 upheld the decision below that a
perforated roll is not a <i>copy</i> in fact of staff notation, and thus
limited the statutory use of the word to duplication by similar or
corresponding process. It was for this reason that such specific phrases
as "to make any other version," "to convert," "to arrange or adapt," "to
make transcription or record" were included in the new code, although
these would be included in the broader sense of the right "to copy."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="54a"></a>Vending</p>

<p>The right to vend covers by a comprehensive word those general rights
of sale through which only can the author obtain remuneration for his
work. The most important question which has arisen in respect to the
application of this word, which is used both in the previous laws and in
the present code, has been as to the use of this exclusive right to limit
the conditions of sale after the original sale from the author or
proprietor as vendor to the immediate vendee. The courts have in general
held that the copyright and patent laws, while creating a legal monopoly
for the author or original proprietor, do not authorize any continuing
control, and have indeed gone so far as to indicate that a sale is
absolute and complete unless limited by special contract within the
principles of common or statutory law of contracts. In the leading case of
Keeler v. Standard Folding Bed Co., the U.&nbsp;S. Supreme Court in 1895,
through Justice Shiras, said:</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="54b"></a>Control of sale</p>

<p>"Upon the doctrine of these cases we think it follows that one who buys
patented articles of manufacture from one authorized to sell them becomes
possessed of an absolute property in such articles, unrestricted in time
or place. Whether a patentee may protect himself and his assignees by
special contracts <a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 55]</span>brought home to the purchaser is not a
question before us and upon which we express no opinion. It is, however,
obvious that such a question would arise as a question of contract, and
not as one under the inherent meaning and effect of the patent laws."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="55"></a>Specific relation to copyrights: the
Macy cases</p>

<p>This question in specific relation to copyrights again came before the
U.&nbsp;S. Supreme Court in a series of cases, known as the Macy cases,
between Isidor and Nathan Straus doing business as R. H. Macy &amp; Co., on
the one side, and the Bobbs-Merrill Co. and Charles Scribner's Sons as the
respective defendants.</p>

<p>In both cases, the publishers had sought to maintain the retail price
of a book, as a right under the copyright law. The Bobbs-Merrill Co.
copyrighted the "Castaway" May 18, 1904, and immediately below the
copyright notice printed the following in each copy: "The price of this
book at retail is one dollar net. No dealer is licensed to sell it at a
less price, and a sale at a less price will be treated as an infringement
of the copyright."</p>

<p>The Scribners sought to accomplish the same purpose as to their
copyright books by printing in their catalogues, invoices and bills of
goods the following notice: "Copyrighted net books published after May 1,
1901, and copyrighted fiction published after February 1, 1902, are sold
on condition that prices be maintained as provided by the regulations of
the American Publishers' Association."</p>

<p>New dealers were required by the American Publishers' Association, in
consideration of a discount allowed by the publisher in question, to enter
into an agreement as indicated, but this agreement Macy &amp; Co. refused
to accept and they bought books as best they could and sold them at "cut
rates," thus inducing <a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 56]</span>dealers from whom the purchases were made to
violate the agreement with the publishers.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="56a"></a>The Bobbs-Merrill case</p>

<p>In the leading case of Bobbs-Merrill Co., appellant, <i>v.</i> Straus,
the opinion of the U.&nbsp;S. Supreme Court was delivered June 1, 1908, by
Justice Day, who said: "The precise question in this case is, does the
sole right to vend (named in section 4952) secure to the owner of the
copyright the right, after a sale of the book to a purchaser, to restrict
future sales of the book at retail to the right to sell it at a certain
price per copy, because of a notice in the book that a sale at a different
price will be treated as an infringement, which notice has been brought
home to one undertaking to sell for less than the named sum? We do not
think the statute can be given such a construction, and it is to be
remembered that this is purely a question of statutory construction. There
is no claim in this case of contract limitation, nor license agreement
controlling the subsequent sales of the book. In our view the copyright
statutes, while protecting the owner of the copyright in his right to
multiply and sell his production, do not create the right to impose by
notice, such as is disclosed in this case, a limitation at which the book
shall be sold at retail by future purchasers, with whom there is no
privity of contract."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="56b"></a>The Scribner case</p>

<p>In the Scribner case the decision delivered on the same day by the same
justice, upheld the lower courts in their view, "that there was nothing in
any of the notices of a claim of right or reservation under the copyright
law," and "that independent of statutory law" the question of relief in
equity was not open to the federal courts because there was no diversity
of citizenship nor claim above $2000 "requisite to confer jurisdiction of
questions of rights independent of the copyright statutes." On the
allegations of the <a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 57]</span>bill as to alleged contributory infringement
by inducing dealers to sell in violation of agreement, on which the lower
courts held that complainants had not proved an agreement based upon their
printed notice, the Supreme Court declined to review the question of
fact.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="57a"></a>English underselling case</p>

<p>In the English case of Larby <i>v.</i> Love, in 1910, however, Justice
Bucknill in the King's Bench held the defendant liable for damages for the
sale of certain maps to undersellers in disregard of prohibitions
specified in the bill of sale.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="57b"></a>Suits under state law</p>

<p>The Macy cases included suits in the New York State courts by Straus
<i>v.</i> American Publishers' Association <i>et al.</i>, claiming that
the action of the publishers in endeavoring to maintain rates constituted
a conspiracy in restraint of trade contrary to the statutes. The N. Y.
Court of Appeals held, through Chief Judge Parker, that the agreements
would have been free from legal objections if confined solely to copyright
publications, but were contrary to the statute in affecting the right of a
dealer to sell books not copyrighted at the price he chooses. The
copyright side of the question was again pressed in the lower courts and
reached the Court of Appeals a second time in 1908, when it was passed
upon by a divided court, four to three, Judge Gray for the court declining
to review its previous action. The dissenting judges, through Judge
Bartlett, held that the decision of the U.&nbsp;S. Supreme Court in the
Bobbs-Merrill case did apply in the current case and that the State Court
of Appeals should therefore conform its decision to the finding of the
federal Supreme Court. The question has been brought into the federal
courts in a new series of suits, and it has yet to be finally settled by
the U.&nbsp;S. Supreme Court, whether the legal monopoly conferred by the
copyright statute safeguards <a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 58]</span>the copyright proprietor against certain
provisions of the anti-trust laws, state or national.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="58a"></a>Translating<br />

<a name="58b"></a>"Other version"</p>

<p>The right "to translate into other languages or dialects" is
strengthened in the new American code by the addition of the phrase "or to
make any other version thereof," and the author is thus given exclusive
right and entire control as to translation of his original work by himself
or others, without specific reservation of rights except as implied and
included in the general copyright notice. The broad phrase "make any
other version thereof" may cover not only translation into another
language, but into another literary form as from prose into poetry or
<i>vice versa</i>. No case involving construction of this phrase seems yet
to have arisen to be decided by the courts; but the author of a narrative
poem, like Owen Meredith's "Lucile" or Tennyson's "Enoch Arden," could
probably prevent the transformation of his poetical work into equivalent
prose; and a novelist would have probably a like protection in case of an
attempt to duplicate or transform his story as a narrative poem. This view
is confirmed by the analogous specific protection of the right to
dramatize a work or convert a drama into non-dramatic form.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="58c"></a>Translating term</p>

<p>The exclusive right "to translate the copyrighted work into other
languages or dialects, or make any other version thereof, if it be a
literary work; to dramatize it if it be a non-dramatic work" are granted
by the act for the same period as the term of original copyright and the
renewal term, instead of for a shorter period, as ten years, as is the
case in certain foreign legislation. The right to translate or to
dramatize is separate from the right to copyright a translation or
dramatization, as is shown by the fact that a translation or dramatization
can be separately copyrighted for a term extending from its own date of <a
name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
59]</span>publication and therefore possibly beyond the copyright term of
the original work, though on the expiration of the primary copyright any
one else may make a translation or dramatization despite the continuing
existence of the copyright in the authorized translation or dramatization.
These subjects are more specifically discussed for translations under the
subject-matter of copyright and for dramatizations under dramatic and
musical copyright.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="59a"></a>Oral delivery</p>

<p>The exclusive right to deliver orally addresses and similar productions
is now specifically included in the American law, as in the laws of some
other countries, and probably involves the right to register, before
publication, any literary production intended for oral delivery before it
is printed in a book or periodical. Thus if Mr. Cable desires to include
in his readings, especially if in public for profit, chapters from an
unpublished novel, or a poet desires to protect his copyright in a poem
which he publicly recites, it may be desirable that he should register
such unpublished work under the provisions of the act for that purpose;
although it is a generally accepted doctrine that oral delivery does not
constitute publication, and that the matter orally delivered may thus be
protected at common law.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="59b"></a>"Publicly and for profit"</p>

<p>It should be noted that in the case of a lecture or other work for oral
delivery and of a musical composition, the exclusive right is given for
its delivery or performance "publicly and for profit," and in the case of
a drama, "publicly," the words for profit being, probably by inadvertence,
omitted. There is some question, therefore, whether a copyrighted lecture,
drama, or musical composition can be given without consent of the author
privately, or, except in the case of a drama, gratuitously before the
public. In view of the special exception (sec. 28) exempting oratorios, <a
name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 60]</span>etc.,
performed for charitable or educational purposes and not for profit, from
authorization or payment, as well as on general principles of
construction, it would seem probable that the courts would protect the
author of a lecture, drama, or musical composition, except in such
instances as a private rendering in a private house, to which there was
not public admission and at which no fee was charged or collection taken.
The cases bearing on this point are given in the later chapter on dramatic
and musical copyright.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="60"></a>Material and immaterial property</p>

<p>The American code adopts into the law an important distinction as
between the property in the material and the immaterial rights, hitherto
somewhat uncertain, in the following provision (sec. 41): "That the
copyright is distinct from the property in the material object
copyrighted, and the sale, or conveyance, by gift or otherwise, of the
material object shall not of itself constitute a transfer of the
copyright, nor shall the assignment of the copyright constitute a transfer
of the title to the material object; but nothing in this Act shall be
deemed to forbid, prevent, or restrict the transfer of any copy of a
copyrighted work the possession of which has been lawfully obtained."</p>

<p>The negative provision in this section was inserted in the new
copyright law apparently to differentiate it from patent law with the
intent of preventing the proprietor of a copyrighted work from controlling
the conditions of sale after copies had left his possession. It is
doubtful what, if any, effect this provision may have, as the phrase
"lawfully obtained" would scarcely have the result of limiting and
annulling contractual conditions of sale. The innocent purchase of a
stolen book would not relieve the purchaser from the necessity of
returning the stolen property to its proper owner, although as far as
intent, knowledge, <a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 61]</span>and payment are concerned, he would have
"lawfully obtained" it.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="61a"></a>Schemes not copyrightable</p>

<p>The scope of copyright cannot be extended to cover a business or other
scheme described in a copyrighted book, as was held in 1906 in Burk
<i>v</i>. Johnson by the Circuit Court of Appeals in denying relief under
copyright protection to the originator of a mutual burial association who
copyrighted the articles of association.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="61b"></a>The new British code</p>

<p>The new British measure defines copyright to mean "the sole right to
produce or reproduce the work or any substantial part thereof in any
material form whatsoever and in any language," thus assuring rights of
translation hitherto imperfect or doubtful; "to perform, or in the case of
a lecture to deliver, the work or any substantial part thereof in public;
if the work is unpublished, to publish the work"; and specifically
includes the sole right of dramatization (from an "artistic," as well as
other non-dramatic work), novelization, and reproduction by mechanical
means (though with compulsory license provision as to reproduced music). A
copyright may be assigned or licensed "either wholly or partially, and
either generally or subject to limitations to any particular country, and
either for the whole term of the copyright or for any part thereof."</p>

<p>"Copyright or any similar right in any literary dramatic musical or
artistic work, whether published or unpublished," is expressly denied
"otherwise than under and in accordance with the provisions of this Act"
or other statutory enactment; and thus common law seems to be totally
abrogated. Hitherto common law property in an unpublished work has been
absolute and co-existed with statutory remedies up to publication, as was
strongly upheld in 1908 in Mansell <i>v</i>. Valley Printing Co. in the
English Court of Appeal. <a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 62]</span>As to published works, the new code
continues the settled law reiterated as late as 1910 in Monckton <i>v</i>.
The Gramaphone Co., where Justice Joyce in the Chancery Division denied
the common law claim of the author of a song printed with prohibition of
mechanical production, on the ground that after publication there was no
copyright except as given by statute.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="62a"></a>Foreign statutes</p>

<p>The statutes of foreign countries are in general of similar scope,
though with variations of extent and phraseology in the several countries.
The broadest seems to be that of Siam, above cited, translating common law
rights into statutory privilege, though that country also contradictorily
limits copyright in books by a manufacturing clause. Spain specifically
protects works produced or published by "any kind of impression or
reproduction known now or subsequently invented," as elsewhere quoted.
France specifically gives an author right to assign his property in whole
or in part&mdash;a right which is probably included in other countries
under the general construction of statutory rights in property.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="62b"></a>International provisions</p>

<p>The international copyright convention, as modified at Berlin, does not
define the scope of copyright, but insures for authors the enjoyment of
such rights as the domestic laws accord to natives; but in its several
articles it makes specific provision as to representation, translation,
adaptation, mechanical reproduction, etc., as set forth in the chapter on
international copyright conventions.</p>

<p>Common law, or a crude equivalent for it, as enforced by the courts,
seems to extend copyright protection, in the absence of specific
legislation, in Montenegro, Egypt and Liberia, Honduras, the Dominican
Republic, and Uruguay, as formerly in Argentina.</p>

<h4>SUBJECT-MATTER OF COPYRIGHT: WHAT MAY BE COPYRIGHTED</h4>

<p class="p2 sidenote"><a name="63a"></a>Subject-matter in general</p>

<p>The subject-matter of copyright should include, in the nature of
things, those products of invention, creations of the human brain, which
are realized and utilized immaterially through material records, and not,
as in the case of patents, materially through the material itself.
Copyrightable works, in brief, are those which appeal from the imagination
to the imagination, or in which intellectual labor combines immaterial
product into new form. What may be copyrighted specifically and
practically depends, under present conditions of law, upon the statutory
provisions, national or international, of the several nations of the
world.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="63b"></a>Classification</p>

<p>The new American code gives the following classification of
copyrightable works:</p>

<p>"(Sec. 5.) That the application for registration shall specify to which
of the following classes the work in which copyright is claimed
belongs:</p>

<p>"(a) Books, including composite and cyclopædic works, directories,
gazetteers, and other compilations;</p>

<p>"(b) Periodicals, including newspapers;</p>

<p>"(c) Lectures, sermons, addresses, prepared for oral delivery;</p>

<p>"(d) Dramatic or dramatico-musical compositions;</p>

<p>"(e) Musical compositions;</p>

<p>"(f) Maps;</p>

<p>"(g) Works of art; models or designs for works of art;</p>

<p><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 64]</span>
"(h) Reproductions of a work of art;</p>

<p>"(i) Drawings or plastic works of a scientific or technical
character;</p>

<p>"(j) Photographs;</p>

<p>"(k) Prints and pictorial illustrations:</p>

<p>"<i>Provided, nevertheless</i>, That the above specifications shall not
be held to limit the subject-matter of copyright as defined in section
four of this Act, nor shall any error in classification invalidate or
impair the copyright protection secured under this Act."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="64a"></a>Prints and labels excluded</p>

<p>Prints or labels "not connected with the fine arts," but "designed to
be used for any other articles of manufacture," are subject only to
registration in the Patent Office in accordance with the act of June 18,
1874.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="64b"></a>All the writings of an author</p>

<p>It is enacted (sec. 4): "That the works for which copyright may be
secured under this Act shall include all the writings of an author," thus
linking the phraseology of the law with the provision in the Constitution
of the United States in which the word "writings" is used, with the effect
of construing that word by the classification above cited.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="64c"></a>Component parts</p>

<p>It is also enacted (sec. 3): "That the copyright provided by this Act
shall protect all the copyrightable component parts of the work
copyrighted, and all matter therein in which copyright is already
subsisting, but without extending the duration or scope of such copyright.
The copyright upon composite works or periodicals shall give to the
proprietor thereof all the rights in respect thereto which he would have
if each part were individually copyrighted under this Act."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="64d"></a>Compilations, new editions, etc.</p>

<p>It is also enacted (sec. 6): "That compilations or abridgments,
adaptations, arrangements, dramatizations, translations, or other versions
of works in the public domain, or of copyrighted works when produced <a
name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 65]</span>with
the consent of the proprietor of the copyright in such works, or works
republished with new matter, shall be regarded as new works subject to
copyright under the provisions of this Act; but the publication of any
such new works shall not affect the force or validity of any subsisting
copyright upon the matter employed or any part thereof, or be construed to
imply an exclusive right to such use of the original works, or to secure
or extend copyright in such original works."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="65a"></a>Non-copyrightable works</p>

<p>The provisions of the law regarding the subject-matter of copyright are
completed by the negative provision:</p>

<p>"(Sec. 7.) That no copyright shall subsist in the original text of any
work which is in the public domain, or in any work which was published in
this country or any foreign country prior to the going into effect of this
Act and has not been already copyrighted in the United States, or in any
publication of the United States Government, or any reprint, in whole or
in part, thereof: <i>Provided, however</i>, That the publication or
republication by the Government, either separately or in a public
document, of any material in which copyright is subsisting shall not be
taken to cause any abridgment or annulment of the copyright or to
authorize any use or appropriation of such copyright material without the
consent of the copyright proprietor."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="65b"></a>Government use</p>

<p>It is not to be inferred from the provision as to Government
publications, that the United States has itself a right to use copyright
material without consent of the copyright proprietor. The sovereignty of
the nation is not to transgress the rights of private property, unless in
the necessary exercise of war or police powers, as the sovereign state
cannot take land over which it is theoretically sovereign from a private
<a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
66]</span>owner except for public purposes and then only by condemnation
proceedings at law and with fair remuneration to the proprietor. No right
of eminent domain in respect to copyrights is asserted by the United
States, and the provision means only that material, otherwise
copyrightable, furnished by a public officer or otherwise to the
Government, becoming the property of the Government, is put freely at the
service of the people.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="66a"></a>"Author" and "writing"
definitions</p>

<p>The constitutional provision is thus given the broadest interpretation
in the act. In the narrow sense the dictionaries define "author" as "one
who composes or writes a <i>book</i>" (Webster), and "writing" variously
as "a record made by <i>hand</i>," "a production of the <i>pen</i>," "any
expression of thought in <i>visible</i> words" (Century); "anything
expressed in <i>letters</i>" (Webster, Stormonth, Standard); "a written
paper," "a legal instrument" (Johnson); "a literary production"
(Chambers); "forming by the hand letters or characters on paper or other
suitable substance" (Bouvier's Law Dictionary); "words made <i>legible</i>
by any device," "a document, whether manuscript or printed, as opposed to
mere spoken words" (Rapalje and Lawrence, Law Dict.); "expression of ideas
by visible letters" (Anderson's Dict. of Law). For years Massachusetts
voters cast a handwriting ballot, until the courts held that a printed
ballot fulfilled the "written ballot" requirement of the Massachusetts
constitution. But in the wider sense an author is "a creator, an
originator" (Webster, Standard), and a writing is the record or expression
of a thought or idea.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="66b"></a>Interpretation by Congress and
courts</p>

<p>Congress, upheld by the courts, had specifically included (law of 1870)
under "writings" in the Constitution a "statue," "statuary," "model,"
without requiring the artist to make a preliminary sketch (if that be
specifically a writing)&mdash;otherwise, as sculptors <a name="Page_67"
id="Page_67"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 67]</span>are not "inventors"
making "discoveries," they could not be protected at all; and in other
countries protection has been extended to oral delivery of an address
presumably but not necessarily written. It might be claimed, under a
restrictive interpretation of the Constitution, that only works
specifically relating to "science and useful arts" might be protected,
although literature and the fine arts are admittedly especial subjects of
copyright. While it is for the judiciary and not for the legislature to
construe or interpret the Constitution, the right of Congress to pass laws
based upon its understanding of the Constitution, subject to the final
decision of the federal courts, has not been challenged. And the code of
1909 by its classification (sec. 5) and its inclusive clause (sec. 4) is
most comprehensive in this respect.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="67"></a>Supreme Court decisions</p>

<p>The U.&nbsp;S. Supreme Court, in 1884, in the decision of Burrow-Giles
Lith. Co. <i>v.</i> Sarony, extending the principles of the copyright act
to cover photographs, said through Justice Miller: "By 'writings' is meant
the literary productions of those authors, and Congress very properly has
declared these to include all forms of writings, printing, engraving,
etching, etc., by which the ideas in the mind of the author are given
visible expression. The only reason why photographs were not included in
the extended list of 1802 is probably that they did not exist, as
photography as an art was then unknown." It seems evident that the phrase
"visible expression" as used in this decision was intended to give a broad
definition and not to narrow the definition by the exclusion, for
instance, of "audible expression," as otherwise the <i>performance</i> of
a drama or of a musical composition could not be included under copyright
protection. This view is confirmed by the later decision of the same
court, in 1899, in Holmes <i>v.</i> Hurst: "It is the intellectual
production <a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
68]</span>of the author which the copyright protects, and not the
particular form which such production ultimately takes; and the word
'book' is not to be understood in its technical sense as a bound volume,
but any species of publication which the author selects to embody his
literary product."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="68a"></a>Originality and merit</p>

<p>The courts are disposed to extend copyright to any work involving
intellectual labor or brain skill, without emphasizing originality or
literary merit. In the important case of Walter <i>v.</i> Lane, in which a
<i>verbatim</i> report of Lord Rosebery's speeches was protected, by
decision of the House of Lords, in 1900, Lord Chancellor Halsbury said:
"Although I think in these compositions (<i>i. e.</i> the work of the
stenographer) there is literary merit and intellectual labor, yet the
statute seems to me to require neither&mdash;nor originality either in
thought or language ... the right in my view is given by the statute to
the first producer of a book, whether that book be wise or foolish,
accurate or inaccurate, of literary merit, or of no merit whatever."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="68b"></a>"Book" definitions</p>

<p>The word "book" covers the great body of copyright property, and has
been many times the subject of judicial construction giving the most
comprehensive meaning to the term. The English judges early held that
protection "could not depend upon the form of the publication"; "that a
composition on a single sheet might well be a book within the meaning of
the legislature"; and that "any composition, whether large or small, is a
book within the meaning of this act." The English law of 1842 afterward
specifically construed the word "book" "to mean and include every volume,
part or division of a volume, pamphlet, sheet of letterpress, sheet of
music, map, chart or plan, separately published." The law of the United
States makes no definition of the term, except by specifically including
as books "composite <a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 69]</span>and cyclopædic works, directories,
gazetteers, and other compilations"; but our judges have agreed with the
English view, Judge Thompson holding, in 1828, in Clayton <i>v.</i> Stone,
that a "book" may be printed "only on one sheet," and that "the literary
property intended to be protected by the Act is not to be determined by
the size, form or shape ... but by the subject-matter," and Judge Leavitt,
in 1862, in Drury v. Ewing, that a diagram for cutting dresses, with
directions, printed on a single sheet, being "the product of thought and
mental toil," was a "book" within the benefit of the law.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Inclusions adjudicated</p>

<p>In fact, though all English and American statutes have been avowedly
for "the encouragement of learning" and "the progress of science and
useful arts," the courts have construed the laws to cover in the widest
sense any "useful book." The courts have indeed denied copyright
protection only to works having absolutely no literary quality, such as
advertisements (unless they contain original literary matter) and
advertising cuts, labels, blank books, or blank forms. Even booksellers'
and other trade catalogues, having descriptive notes or distinctive
arrangement and combination, can be copyrighted. Compilations of existing
materials, from common sources, arranged and combined in an original and
useful form, receive the same protection as wholly original matter. Drone
schedules English or American judicial constructions extending this
principle to: (1) general miscellaneous compilations; (2) annotations
consisting of common materials; (3) dictionaries; (4) books of chronology;
(5) gazetteers; (6) itineraries, road and guide books; (7) directories;
(8) maps and charts; (9) calendars; (10) catalogues; (11) mathematical
tables; (12) a list of hounds; (13) abstracts of titles to lands; and
collections of (14) statistics, (15) statutory <a name="Page_70"
id="Page_70"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 70]</span>forms, (16) recipes,
and (17) designs&mdash;several of which classes are now specifically
included in the new American statute. Later decisions have confirmed
several of these categories and have specified also (18) trotting records;
(19) racing charts; (20) newspaper reports of public speeches; (21)
telegraphic codes; (22) mining reports; (23) a tradesman's alphabetical
list of wares; (24) a list of public documents; (25) mathematical
calculations; (26) legal forms; (27) an application form for membership;
(28) complications of railroad time-tables; (29) commercial circulars,
protected by a Canadian decision; (30) school registers, and (31) stud
book list of horses.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Exclusions adjudicated</p>

<p>On the other hand, the courts have declined to include as proper
subjects of copyright (a) methods or plans, as for compiling
credit-ratings or systems, as in the case of (b) shorthand, (c) trading
stamps or coupons as described in a copyrighted advertising pamphlet, or
(d) of letter-file indexes; (e) a sleeve pattern chart; (f) the face of a
barometer; (g) a railway ticket designed for punching; (h) a day's
sporting tips; (i) blank books; or (j) blank forms, as a cricket
score-card; and (k) monograms.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Inclusions defined</p>

<p>In the new Rules and Regulations of the Copyright Office promulgated as
approved by the Librarian of Congress in 1910 as Bulletin No. 15, it is
said as to books:</p>

<p>"(4, <i>a</i>) <i>Books.</i>&mdash;This term includes all printed
literary works (except dramatic compositions) whether published in the
ordinary shape of a book or pamphlet, or printed as a leaflet, card, or
single page. The term 'book' as used in the law includes tabulated forms
of information, frequently called charts; tables of figures showing the
results of mathematical computations such as logarithmic tables; interest,
cost, and wage tables, etc., single poems, and the words of <a
name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 71]</span>a song
when printed and published without music; librettos; descriptions of
moving pictures or spectacles; encyclopædias; catalogues; directories;
gazetteers and similar compilations; circulars or folders containing
information in the form of reading matter other than mere lists of
articles, names and addresses, and literary contributions to periodicals
or newspapers."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Exclusions defined</p>

<p>On the other hand, definitions are made negatively that:</p>

<p>"(5) The term 'book' can not be applied to&mdash;</p>

<p>"Blank books for use in business or in carrying out any system of
transacting affairs, such as record books, account books, memorandum
books, diaries or journals, bank deposit and check books; forms of
contracts or leases which do not contain original copyrightable matter;
coupons; forms for use in commercial, legal, or financial transactions,
which are wholly or partly blank and whose value lies in their usefulness
and not in their merit as literary compositions.</p>

<p>"Directions on scales, or dials, or mathematical or other instruments;
puzzles; games; rebuses; labels; wrappers; formulæ on boxes, bottles, and
other receptacles of articles for sale or meant to accompany such
articles.</p>

<p>"Advertisements or catalogues which merely set forth the names, prices,
and places where articles are for sale.</p>

<p>"Prefaces or other introductory matter to works not themselves entitled
to copyright protection, such as blank books.</p>

<p>"Calendars are not capable of registration as such, but if they contain
copyrightable reading matter or pictures they may be registered either as
'books' or as 'prints' according to the nature of the copyrightable
matter."</p>

<p><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 72]</span>
The Rules also make the following negative definitions:</p>

<p>"(12) No copyright exists in toys, games, dolls, advertising novelties,
instruments or tools of any kind, glassware, embroideries, garments,
laces, woven fabrics, or any similar articles."</p>

<p>The definition of other classes of subject-matter given in the new
Rules and Regulations of the Copyright Office, including that of maps,
will be found in the chapters on dramatic and musical copyright and on
artistic copyright.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="72"></a>Blank books</p>

<p>In the case of Everson <i>v.</i> Young, then Librarian of Congress,
Judge Cole, of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, in 1889,
refused a mandamus against the copyright officer while admitting that "the
librarian had no discretion" on the ground that mandamus "will not be used
to order a vain thing to be done" and that a blank book "containing not a
single English sentence" is not a subject of copyright.</p>

<p>"The copyright statutes," as is said in Circular Letter no. 32 of the
Copyright Office, "in designating the classes of articles which may be
registered in this office do not mention blank forms or blank books. The
United States courts which have jurisdiction in cases arising under the
copyright laws have held that blank forms or blank books or similar
articles <i>for use in themselves</i> are not subject to copyright, and
hence are not registrable in this office. A bill was introduced in
Congress in 1904 proposing to extend the protection of the copyright law
to vouchers, certificates, or other business forms, wholly or partly
printed. But the measure was not favorably acted upon and did not become
law." This exclusion does not refer to such publications as an insurance
policy or a legal document, on which blank spaces are to be filled in,
which <a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
73]</span>are accepted as proper subject-matter for copyright by the
Copyright Office.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="73a"></a>Combinations and arrangements</p>

<p>The copyright under certain categories above scheduled may be in the
combination and arrangement only, or it may be also in any original
material included with other material. Quantity is not an essential
element in copyright so much as "substantial importance." An English court
protected a passage of only sixty words.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="73b"></a>Advertisements</p>

<p>In respect to advertisements and advertising matter as such, the new
American code is silent, and court decisions, mostly English, have been
contradictory. In 1863 Vice-Chancellor Page Wood, in Hotten <i>v.</i>
Arthur, "found no difficulty" in deciding that a catalogue of old books
was a subject of copyright "notwithstanding that the catalogues were for
the purpose of advertising the plaintiffs' stock-in-trade, and were not in
themselves offered for sale"; but in 1872 Lord Romilly, in Cobbett
<i>v.</i> Woodward, made an absolutely contrary decision, saying: "But at
the last, it comes round to this, that there is no copyright in an
advertisement. If you copy the advertisement of another, you do him no
wrong in doing so, unless you lead the public to believe that you sell the
articles of the person whose advertisement you copy." This last decision
was definitely overruled and in 1882, in Maple <i>v.</i> Junior Army &amp;
Navy Stores, the English Court of Appeal, in protecting an advertising
catalogue consisting mostly of engravings of furniture, said through
Justice Jessel: "The case which has done all the mischief is Cobbett
<i>v.</i> Woodward.... I think that is not law. I am not aware that the
use to which a proprietor puts his book makes any difference in his
rights." In 1906, in Davis <i>v.</i> Benjamin, the Chancery Division held
a sheet of advertising illustrations with headlines and prices a book.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Undistinctive advertising not protectable</p>

<p><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
74]</span>An advertisement <i>per se</i> of an ordinary character, the
courts may decline to protect, either on behalf of the advertiser or of
the publisher of the periodical in which it appears; thus possibly
ordinary advertisements might be copied by another paper, to give an
inflated impression of its advertising patronage unless enjoined for
intent to deceive. On the other hand, characteristic advertisements, as
those for which department stores pay large sums to advertisement writers,
could doubtless be copyrighted to prevent their use by rival firms, though
the advertiser would scarcely be interested in preventing the wide
diffusion of his advertisement with his name by its gratuitous publication
elsewhere. Some street-car advertisements, however, bear copyright
notices. Whether the proprietor of a copyrighted periodical could prevent
the use of a copyrightable advertisement not protected by specific
copyright, in a rival newspaper, would be questionable, though a publisher
might be granted an injunction for the combination or arrangement of
copyrightable advertisements in his periodical. In 1892, in Lamb <i>v.</i>
Evans, Lord Justice Lindley, in the English Court of Appeal, said: "I do
not see myself the difficulty in the publisher's having a copyright in a
sheet of advertisements. I do see a difficulty in his having a copyright
in one advertisement, because, as Mr. Justice Chitty pointed out, that
might prevent the advertiser from republishing his advertisements in
another paper, which is absurd." An advertisement appearing in several
publications, some of them not copyrighted, could only be protected in
these latter by specific copyright notice, even though covered in the
copyrighted periodicals as a component part. The Copyright Office can make
no clear line of demarcation in advance as to advertisements, but it has
declined in a recent instance to accept for registry <a name="Page_75"
id="Page_75"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 75]</span>recipes printed on
tin and inserted in packages of flour to advertise the flour, which could
scarcely be accepted as a "book" or other copyrightable matter.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="75"></a>New editions</p>

<p>New editions are protected under the American code as new works (sec.
6), to the extent that they include new material; and this is in accord
with the whole trend of court decisions. In 1852 Vice-Chancellor
Kindersley stated the doctrine that "if a man prints a second edition, not
being a mere reprint of the first edition, but containing considerable and
material alterations and additions, <i>quoad</i> those, it is a new work."
So in 1870, in Black <i>v.</i> Murray &amp; Son, Lockhart's edition of
Scott's "Border Minstrelsy" was protected, on Lord President Inglis'
decision, to the full extent of the notes: "Questions of great nicety and
difficulty may arise as to how far a new edition of a work is a proper
subject of copyright at all; but that must always depend upon
circumstances. A new edition of a book may be a mere reprint of an old
edition, and plainly that would not entitle the author to a new term of
copyright running from the date of the new edition. On the other hand, the
new edition of a book may be so enlarged and improved as to constitute in
reality a new work, and that just as clearly will entitle the author to a
copyright running from the date of the new edition." A few colorable
alterations or unimportant notes may not justify a new copyright; a Scotch
justice, however, contended that Walter Scott's change of a single word in
"Glenallan's Earl" authorized a copyright for the new edition, though
another law lord differed, and the case was decided on other grounds. It
is doubtful indeed whether there can be protection of a single word, a
question which arose in the <i>Belgravia</i> case, unless having
association in the public mind as a trade-mark. In any event, the
copyright on a new <a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 76]</span>edition, whether made by rewriting,
extending, condensing, annotating, or otherwise altering, runs
independently of the term of the original or any other edition, covers
only the new parts, and cannot prevent the issue by others of the original
or any other edition on which copyright has expired. This is made entirely
clear in the new code (sec. 6).</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="76a"></a>Copyright comprehensive</p>

<p>"A book must include every part of the book; it must include every
print, design, or engraving which forms part of the book, as well as the
letterpress therein, which is another part of it," according to the ruling
decision of Vice-Chancellor Parker, in 1852, in the English case of Bogue
<i>v.</i> Houlston. To the same effect Drone says: "The copyright protects
the whole and all the parts and contents of a book: when the book
comprises a number of independent compositions, each of the latter is as
fully protected as the whole." The copyright under the new law protects
(sec. 3) "all the copyrightable component parts of the work copyrighted."
The practice of some publishers in copyrighting a magazine and also
specific articles or engravings seems, therefore, a work of doubtful
expediency. The new law specifically gives to the proprietor of "composite
works or periodicals" (sec. 3) "all the rights in respect thereto which he
would have if each part were individually copyrighted."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="76b"></a>Non-copyrightable parts excepted</p>

<p>On the other hand, copyright cannot extend to any part of a book not
subject in itself to copyright, even under the old law, and the new law
(sec. 3) is perfectly plain. The general copyright is not, however,
vitiated as to copyrightable portions by its seeming to cover
non-copyrightable portions, as was held by Lord Kenyon, in 1801, in Cary
<i>v.</i> Longman. But when copyright is claimed on a work partly composed
of uncopyrightable matter the courts may require the <a name="Page_77"
id="Page_77"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 77]</span>claimant, on
interrogatories, to designate which parts are and which are not original.
"If the parts cannot be separated," says Drone, "it would seem that
copyright will not vest in any of it." The new code is to the same
effect.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="77a"></a>Book illustrations</p>

<p>The application of these principles to the protection of a "new
edition" which is new only with respect to added illustrations, is very
simple. It is only the new illustrations which can be copyrighted, and it
is matter for question whether the endeavor to protect an edition of
unaltered text by a general copyright notice which really covers only a
few added illustrations would not be a false use of the copyright notice.
A proper copyright notice on an illustrated book will, however, protect
the illustrations against indirect as well as direct reproduction; thus in
1908 in Harper <i>v.</i> Kalem, Judge Lacombe in the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit
Court in New York protected certain illustrations in "Ben Hur" against
their reproduction in moving pictures.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="77b"></a>Translations</p>

<p>In respect to translations, the new American law is specific, not only
in its mention of "translations" (sec. 6), but in giving (sec. 1, b) the
exclusive right "to translate the copyrighted work into other languages or
dialects, or make any other version thereof, if it be a literary work."
The early American precedent was the case of "Uncle Tom's cabin," in 1853,
in which Mrs. Stowe had copyrighted not only the original work, but a
German translation which she had provided; Justice Grier in the U.&nbsp;S.
Circuit Court held that she could not recover against one Thomas who was
issuing another German translation, since it was not "<i>copies</i> of her
<i>book</i>." This case was previous to the statute permitting authors to
reserve the right of translation, and the new code as above cited fully
protects translations. The author of a copyrighted <a name="Page_78"
id="Page_78"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 78]</span>work thus has the
exclusive right to translate his work, or license its translation, into
any other language, and under such a license the translator with the
consent of the author would have the right to copyright his translation.
Where the author employs a translator for hire, the copyright in the
translation may be secured by the author of the original work, but under
ordinary circumstances the copyright in the translation would be secured
by or on behalf of the translator. In case of contest on this point, the
issue would be a question of contract, and in the absence of contract or
specific assent the courts would doubtless base their decisions on the
circumstances of the case so far as they could be held to imply contract.
The inclusion of the notice of copyright of the original work on a
translation, without specific copyright of the translation itself, would
be held, it seems probable, to protect the translation under the author's
original copyright; but this would limit the copyright term on the
translation to the copyright term of the original work, and for this and
other reasons a specific copyright on each translation is desirable, in
which case the notice of copyright of the original work need not be given
on the translation.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="78"></a>Translator's rights</p>

<p>In the case of the translation of a copyright work, the author of the
original work has the right to prevent other translations, but the
translator has no such right to prevent translation by another translator
except as exclusive right to translate is conveyed or implied to him by
the author of the original work. A work in the public domain, as a
non-copyright work or a work on which copyright has expired, may be
translated by any one and the translation copyrighted, but such translator
would not have the right to prevent translation by another translator.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="79a"></a>English practice</p>

<p>In England, while the right of translation may be <a name="Page_79"
id="Page_79"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 79]</span>reserved under the
international copyright act by notice on the title-page, an English author
could reserve his right of translation only by providing such translation,
but the new code gives the full right.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="79b"></a>Translations in international
relations</p>

<p>The American provisions as to translations apply with especial
importance to international relations. "The original text of a book of
foreign origin in a language or languages other than English" is
copyrightable in America without manufacture here; and such a work, duly
copyrighted, can only be translated into English or any other language by
authority of the foreign author or his assigns, and such translation in
English or any other language can be copyrighted only when manufactured in
this country as provided in the act. If the original text of a foreign
work is not duly copyrighted under the American law, then translation is
open to any one and copyright can be secured only for the particular
translation copyrighted, as above stated, and this cannot prevent
independent translation into the same or any other language. Thus, a
German original duly copyrighted may not be translated into English,
French, or any other language without authority of the copyright
proprietor, nor can an English translation be made, for instance, from a
French translation of the copyrighted work; but any number of translations
of the copyrighted German work into English or any other language may be
separately copyrighted under the American law, subject to the
manufacturing clause, if duly authorized by the copyright proprietor, and
each translator could only prevent the copying of his particular
translation or the translation of his own version into another
language.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="79c"></a>Foreign translators</p>

<p>A translation can be copyrighted by a translator only in case he is a
citizen of a country with which the United States has copyright relations
or is a resident <a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 80]</span>of this country; thus a Swedish translation
by a citizen of Sweden not resident in the United States could not be
copyrighted unless the translator had been "employed for hire" by the
author or proprietor of the original copyrighted work. If the entire
copyright of the original work had been sold by the author to a citizen of
Sweden, not a resident in the United States, it would seem to follow that
the latter could not copyright a translation though he might retain the
right to prevent unauthorized translation under the general copyright
which he had purchased. In the case of an authorized independent
translation made by a Swedish citizen not resident here, the general
notice of copyright of the original work might be utilized to protect the
translation, but in such case copies not manufactured in the United States
could not be imported into this country; while if such authorized
translation bore no copyright notice and were imported into the United
States by the author or with his consent, it is probable that this
translation, but not the original work or another translation from either,
would be freed from copyright protection.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="80"></a>Abridgments</p>

<p>In respect to abridgments, these are specifically mentioned (sec. 6) as
copyrightable works, and by inference from this clause and the provision
(sec. 1) giving an author the exclusive right to "make any other version,"
the author or proprietor of a literary work may prevent abridgment of his
work. The courts had held to precedents which the best writers, such as
Curtis, Drone and Copinger, declare to be contradictory to the true
principles of copyright law. In 1740 Lord Hardwicke, deciding against a
mere reprint, "colorably shortened only," of Sir Matthew Hale's "Pleas of
the Crown," declared that he would not restrain "a real and fair
abridgment," and in 1774 Lord Chancellor Apsley, after consultation <a
name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 81]</span>with
Blackstone, held that an abridgment of Hawkesworth's "Voyages," involving
understanding and skill, was not plagiarism or a copyright wrong, but "an
allowable and meritorious work." In the leading American case of Story's
"Commentaries," Story v. Holcombe, in 1847, in the U.&nbsp;S. Supreme
Court, Justice McLean, while expressing his own opinion that "an
abridgment, if fairly made, contains the principle of the original work,
and this constitutes its value," added, "but a contrary doctrine has long
been established in England ... and in this country the same doctrine has
prevailed. I am, therefore, bound by precedent, and I yield to it in this
instance, more as a principle of law than a rule of reason or justice."
Similarly, in Lawrence v. Dana, in 1869, Judge Clifford, in the U.&nbsp;S.
Circuit Court, declared that "an abridgment ought to be regarded as an
infringement ... but the opposite doctrine has been too long established
to be considered open to controversy." The language of the new code frees
the courts from these precedents and settles the American law.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="81a"></a>Compilations</p>

<p>In respect to compilations, these are protected by specific mention
(sec. 6) in the new law, and also by the classification as books (sec. 5,
a) of "composite and cyclopædic works, directories, gazetteers, and other
compilations." Compilations can be protected even if consisting solely of
non-copyright material, "because of the originality, arrangement,
selection, abridgment, or amplification of such simple material," as
stated in the Scotch Court of Session, in the case of Lennie v. Pillans in
1843, with which later English and American decisions are in accord.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="81b"></a>Collections</p>

<p>Collections are copyrightable as compilations or otherwise, and where
the use of copyrighted poems or other copyright material is permitted,
these are protected by general copyright notice on the collection. <a
name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
82]</span>Permission to use a copyrighted poem, for instance, in a
specified collection does not grant a license to use it in other form,
though it could be used in a combination of such collections. In 1896, in
Gabriel <i>v.</i> McCabe, Judge Grosscup in the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court
in Illinois held that the licensor could not prevent the use of a song
licensed for a particular collection in a combination of this collection
in another collection or in an abridged edition of the collection, though
an "abridgment" involving a reprint of the song by itself would have been
an unfair use of the license.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="82a"></a>Titles</p>

<p>As to titles, which are not mentioned in the new code, both English and
American court decisions are broadly and generally, though with some
exceptions, to the effect that there is no copyright protection for the
title of a book <i>per se</i>, but it may be considered an essential part
of the book. Judge Shepley held, in 1872, in his elaborate discussion of
the question of titles in Osgood <i>v.</i> Allen as to the periodical
<i>Our Young Folks</i>, that "the right secured is the property in the
literary composition&mdash;the product of the mind and genius of the
author&mdash;and not in the name or title given to it. The title does not
necessarily involve any literary composition; it may not be, and certainly
the statute does not require that it should be, the product of the
author's mind.... It is a mere appendage, which only identifies, and
frequently does not in any way describe, the literary composition
itself.... If there were no piracy of the copyrighted book there would be
no remedy ... for the use of a title which could not be copyrighted
independently of the book." Judge Lacombe accepted this view in his
decision of the "Trilby" case, cited beyond.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="82b"></a>Changed titles</p>

<p>Conversely, the publication of a copyrighted work under a changed
title, with the original notice of copyright, would probably not
invalidate the copyright, <a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 83]</span>though it would make identification more
difficult and prevent the copyright certificate being <i>prima facie</i>
proof; and change of title is a practice altogether reprehensible. A new
copyright of the same book changed only in title, with a new copyright
notice of later date, could scarcely be construed as a new edition and in
the absence of the original copyright notice the copyright might thus be
abandoned or forfeited and the work be dedicated to the public.</p>

<p class="sidenote">General titles</p>

<p>General titles cannot in any way be protected. The publishers of the
"<i>Bibliographie Universelle</i>," in France, the "Post Office
Directory," in England, and of "Irving's Works," in America, were all
defeated in attempts to prevent the use of those titles.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="83"></a>Titles as trade-marks</p>

<p>Titles are rather to be considered as trade-marks, which may be
registered in the United States under the Trade-Mark acts of 1905-6, and
protected by the statutory penalties, or may be protected on general
principles of equity. This doctrine was early upheld by the English
courts, especially in regard to periodicals, as in the titles of <i>Bell's
Life</i> and the <i>London Journal</i>, and again came before the courts
in the important case of Weldon <i>v.</i> Dicks, as to the specific title
of the novel "Trial and triumph," in which case, in 1878, Vice-Chancellor
Malins enjoined quite another book under the same title, though the title
was chosen in ignorance of the first book and in entire good faith. So,
also, as to the title "Splendid misery," used by Miss Braddon in 1879, Sir
James Bacon, in the Chancery suit of Dicks <i>v.</i> Yates, in 1881, was
inclined to support the claim of C. H. Hazelwood, who had used the title
in 1874, until it was shown that a forgotten novelist named Purr had used
it in 1801, so that it had become, in a measure, common property.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="84"></a>"Chatterbox" cases</p>

<p>In the several American "Chatterbox" cases, <a name="Page_84"
id="Page_84"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 84]</span> Judge Wheeler's
early decision restraining the use of this "name or word, or any name or
word substantially identical therewith," in or upon any juveniles of the
general character of the English book of that name, was followed by Judge
Shipman, in 1887, in Estes <i>v.</i> Worthington, in the U.&nbsp;S.
Circuit Court in New York, who also held that the word "Chatterbox" had
become "a well-known trade-mark designating a well-known series,"
published in a distinctive style and enjoined the rival publication,
simulating the external style, but of different contents. These decisions
previous to 1891, resting on principles of trade-mark and not of
copyright, indirectly assured a measure of international copyright.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Other title decisions</p>

<p>In 1888 the publishers of <i>Life</i> and of "The good things of
<i>Life</i>" obtained an injunction from the N. Y. Supreme Court, in
Mitchell &amp; Miller <i>v.</i> White &amp; Allen, to restrain the
publication of "The spice of life," as seemingly a continuation or
counterpart of the authorized collection of extracts from that periodical.
In 1904, in Gannet <i>v.</i> Rupert, Judge Coxe in the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in New York, on suit of the publishers of <i>Comfort</i>,
restrained the use of the title <i>Home Comfort</i> on a rival periodical
"not as a case of unfair competition" but as "founded on a technical
common law trade-mark"; and characterized the name as "a badge of origin
and genuineness. It is as much a part of the proprietor's property as his
counting room or printing press. A rival publisher has no more right to
appropriate the name of its owner,"&mdash;despite the defence that
<i>Comfort</i> is "a standard English word not fanciful or manufactured."
This defence had precedent in the doubt expressed by Lord Cairns in 1867
in the <i>Belgravia</i> case, cited beyond, as to copyright protection of
a single word, and in the decision of Judge Curtis in Isaacs <i>v.</i>
Daly, in the N. Y. Superior <a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 85]</span>Court in 1874, as to the drama "Charity,"
that "the use of the word 'Charity' as a designation for any work of art
or literature cannot ordinarily be monopolized by any one person"; but
under trade-mark law a single word associated by registry or in the public
mind with a well-known product, may undoubtedly be protected as against
misleading use of the word otherwise. The courts will go even farther in
preventing the use of a title by another person with intent to deceive or
to utilize the reputation of another work or author, as a fraud upon the
public, or as unfair competition, without reference specifically to
trade-mark principles. Thus Judge Newburger of the N. Y. Supreme Court, in
1910, in Eliot and Collier <i>v.</i> Jones and the Circle Publishing
Company, restrained the issue under the title "Dr. Eliot's five-foot
shelf" of books by the defendants of a set of books selected by and issued
under the authority of President Eliot of Harvard, under arrangement with
the co-plaintiff. The English rulings are to the like effect, that while a
title has no copyright protection except as part of a book, the use of a
title to attract purchasers on the supposition that they are getting
another book previously known by that title is a fraud punishable at
common law. Further citations of cases on these points are given in the
chapter on infringement.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="85"></a>Projected titles</p>

<p>There can be no claim to protection for the title of an unpublished
book, as a trade-mark or otherwise, just as there can be no copyright in a
projected book. This question was elaborately discussed in the leading
English case of Maxwell <i>v.</i> Hogg, in 1867, in relation to the
magazine <i>Belgravia</i>, when the rule was laid down that no matter what
expenditure had been made or advertising done, a title was not protectable
previous to its association with a work actually before the public. Judge
Shepley, in 1872, pointed out <a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 86]</span>that "there is no such thing as property in
a trade-mark as an abstract name," for a trade-mark simply shows that
certain goods "were manufactured by a certain person." Nor can an
abandoned title, in the case of a periodical, be held against a person
starting a new periodical of that name, providing it does not purport to
be a continuation of the old, according to a French case quoted by English
authorities.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="86a"></a>Projected works not
copyrightable</p>

<p>There can be no statutory copyright in a book or other work projected
and not yet prepared, despite a very general notion that under the old law
a projected book could be protected by registering a title and depositing
a title-page of an unwritten or unpublished book. There is nothing in
copyright law corresponding to the <i>caveat</i> in patent law. This is
not in conflict with the protection of an unpublished work at common law
or in equity referred to in the new American code (sec. 2) or the
provision in the new law (sec. 11) permitting the registration of "a
lecture or similar production or a dramatic or musical composition" or a
work of art, before publication, with the deposit of a complete copy or
identifying print.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="86b"></a>Immoral works</p>

<p>There can be no copyright in an immoral book, and Lord Eldon, in
Southey <i>v.</i> Sherwood, carried this doctrine so far as to deny the
common law right of an author in a non-innocent manuscript, because there
could be no right to hold what there was no right to sell. His opinion,
resulting in the wide sale of a book which the author desired to suppress,
has been severely criticised by later authorities. In the American case of
Broder <i>v.</i> Zeno Mauvais Music Co., Judge Morrow, in the U.&nbsp;S.
Circuit Court in California, in 1898, held that as a song which the
plaintiff sought to protect contained indecent words, it was not entitled
to protection under the copyright law. There can be no copyright in
blasphemous, seditious, or libelous <a name="Page_87"
id="Page_87"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 87]</span>books; but though
this rule was very strictly enforced by English judges a century ago, the
later courts hesitate to rule strictly on this point, lest the rule be
perverted to sectarianism or despotism. There can be no copyright in books
involving fraud, as those which spuriously obtain salable value by being
represented to be the work of writers who did not write them, or to
contain matter which they do not contain; but this rule does not extend to
books under assumed names or innocently pretending to be what they are
not, as when Horace Walpole's "Castle of Otranto" was put forward as a
translation from the Italian.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="87a"></a>Periodicals</p>

<p>In addition to the inclusion of "composite works," the new American law
specifically covers (sec. 5, b) "periodicals, including newspapers," and
by other provisions of the law above cited, this covers "all copyrightable
component parts." It is further provided (sec. 3) that "the copyright upon
composite works or periodicals shall give to the proprietor thereof all
the rights in respect thereto which he would have if each part were
individually copyrighted under this Act." While the American code does not
specifically provide as to the separate rights of authors in articles in
periodicals or composite works, which must therefore be a matter of
contract, or of practice or precedent implying contract, provision for
separate copyright is implied in a clause (sec. 12) requiring the deposit
of only one copy instead of two in the case of "a contribution to a
periodical, for which contribution special registration is
requested"&mdash;although the specific article is fully protected, as
indicated above, by the general copyright.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="87b"></a>Definition of periodicals</p>

<p>The new Rules and Regulations of the Copyright Office define
periodicals as follows:</p>

<p>"(6) This term includes newspapers, magazines, reviews, and serial
publications appearing oftener than <a name="Page_88"
id="Page_88"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 88]</span>once a year;
bulletins or proceedings of societies, etc., which appear regularly at
intervals of less than a year; and, generally, periodical publications
which would be registered as second class matter at the post office."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="88a"></a>Periodicals under manufacturing
clause</p>

<p>Periodicals, as well as books, are subject to the manufacturing clause
(sec. 15), but affidavit is not required, and the importation of "a
foreign newspaper or magazine, although containing matter copyrighted in
the United States printed or reprinted by authority of the copyright
proprietor," is not prohibited (sec. 31, b), "unless such newspaper or
magazine contains also copyright matter printed or reprinted without such
authorization"&mdash;but these and other conditions are treated in later
chapters.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="88b"></a>Periodicals copyrightable by
numbers</p>

<p>The law provides (sec. 19) in the case of a periodical, that the notice
of copyright may be "either upon the title-page or upon the first page of
text of each separate number or under the title heading," "provided that
one notice of copyright in each volume or in each number of a newspaper or
periodical published shall suffice." This implies that each issue of a
periodical must be separately copyrighted as though a separate work,
although the title may be registered as a trade-mark and possibly
protected in this way. A daily newspaper may thus be copyrighted day by
day at a cost of $365 per year, so as to protect all its original material
of substantial literary value. This was done in fact under the American
law previous to 1909, though periodicals were not specifically mentioned;
a daily price-list of the New York Cotton Exchange was so entered day by
day, but the question of maintaining such a copyright under the old law
seems never to have been tested in the courts, and New York dailies
copyrighted their Sunday cable letters separately.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="89"></a>News</p>

<p>In respect to news, there is no provision in the new <a name="Page_89"
id="Page_89"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 89]</span>code. A bill to
protect news for twenty-four hours was at one time before Congress, but
was never passed. There is, therefore, no copyright protection for news as
such, but the general copyright of the newspaper or a special copyright
may protect the form of a dispatch, letter, or article containing news.
Thus the New York <i>Herald</i> copyrighted without question Dr. Cook's
Arctic dispatches, and the question as to the copyright by the New York
<i>Times</i> of Commander Peary's dispatches describing his dash for the
pole hinged solely on the question of ownership or authority to copyright,
as set forth in a later chapter. But any such copyright could not prevent
publication by other newspapers of the news that Cook and Peary claimed to
have reached the North Pole, at stated dates and under stated
circumstances, though their own form of statement of the facts could not
lawfully be copied except within "fair use."</p>

<p>In 1892 Justice North in the English Court of Chancery, in Walter
<i>v.</i> Steinkopff, said that "although it is sometimes said that there
is no copyright in news, there could be copyright in the particular form
of language or mode of expression by which information is conveyed." The
English courts went further in two actions brought by the Exchange
Telegraph Co., 1895-97, in the first of which Gregory &amp; Co. were
restrained from using information furnished to subscribers first as
unpublished matter before publication, second after publication because of
copyright on the publication, and third as "unfair competition." In 1902,
in Nat. Tel. News Co. <i>v.</i> West. Union Tel. Co., the U.&nbsp;S.
Circuit Court of Appeals protected news on ticker tapes, and in 1910, in
Press Assoc. <i>v.</i> Reporting Agency, the English Chancery Division
protected election reports on the last-named ground alone. </p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="90a"></a>British Periodicals</p>

<p><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
90]</span>The statutes of Great Britain have hitherto provided that a work
published in parts or a periodical may be fully protected by copyright
entry of the first part; the new code covers newspapers and periodicals
generally as collective works. When the London <i>Times'</i> memoir of
Beaconsfield was reprinted as a penny pamphlet, the <i>Times</i> brought
suit as a matter of common law right, but the judge held that a newspaper
was copyrightable under the statute, and therefore that a common law suit
could not hold.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="90b"></a>Oral works</p>

<p>The American law now specifically protects oral works by including in
the classification (sec. 5, c) "lectures, sermons, addresses, prepared for
oral delivery," and by assuring (sec. 1, c) exclusive right "to deliver or
authorize the delivery of the copyrighted work in public for profit if it
be a lecture, sermon, address, or similar production." The phrase "similar
production" and the spirit of the statute suggest that, though the
manuscript of a book cannot be copyrighted prior to publication, a
"reading" from an unpublished book, as a chapter, scene, or poem, might be
registered and protected for oral delivery before publication; and the
Copyright Office will make such registry on such application. The former
law made no specific provision, but the courts seemed disposed to protect
a lecturer on the common law ground that the lecture read is not published
by reading, and can be controlled as a manuscript. In the application of
common law doctrine to extemporaneous or other oral deliveries, the
question of implied contract between the speaker and his auditors enters,
and the trend of court decisions is that a hearer who has purchased or
obtained a ticket, may make notes for his own use but may not publish them
for profit. In the leading English case of Abernethy <i>v.</i> Hutchinson,
in 1825, Lord Chancellor Eldon protected <a name="Page_91"
id="Page_91"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 91]</span> Dr. Abernethy
against the publication of notes of unwritten medical lectures, evidently
obtained through a student hearer.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="91a"></a>Newspaper reports</p>

<p>Newspapers have, however, in practice freely republished lectures, and
probably even under the present law the courts would permit, unless report
was specifically and entirely forbidden by the speaker, a reasonable
report but not a <i>verbatim</i> reproduction of the address, as within
the bounds of "fair use." The publication of an unauthorized report by one
newspaper would not justify another newspaper in copying the report
without consent of the copyright proprietor on the ground of publication,
for such unauthorized publication cannot deprive the copyright proprietor
of his rights. If a speaker delivers an address, extemporaneously or even
from written manuscript without registering the address as an unpublished
work or taking other precautions, it is probable that the courts would
protect his rights at common law; but it would be hazardous not to take
advantage of the statute.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="91b"></a>Lectures in England</p>

<p>Lectures have hitherto been protected in England in case the lecturer
gave notice of reservation in writing two days in advance to two justices
at the place of reading, but this complicated proviso caused speakers to
rely rather on the common law doctrine that oral delivery is not
publication. The new British code specifically provides that delivery is
not publication, but permits newspaper report unless the speaker prohibits
such report by notice posted near the main entrance and except during
public worship near the speaker's position; "newspaper summary" within
"fair dealing" is expressly permitted.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="91c"></a>Letters</p>

<p>Letters are not specified either in English or American statutes under
copyright law. A private letter has been held an unpublished manuscript,
the right <a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
92]</span> to publish or copyright remaining with the author while living,
though the material letter, its paper and ink, has passed to the receiver.
Thus in 1741 Pope prevented Curl, an English bookseller, from republishing
his letters to Swift, and in 1774, in Thompson <i>v.</i> Stanhope, Lord
Chesterfield prevented his son's widow from publishing letters which he
had made a gift to her. Letters, however, are copyrightable by themselves
or as part of a book; and the writer may protect a letter against
unauthorized publication by himself publishing and copyrighting it. The
U.&nbsp;S. Supreme Court in 1841, in Folsom <i>v.</i> Marsh, enjoined the
republication of letters of Washington, published by authority in Sparks's
"Life of Washington," through Justice Story, who said: "The author of any
letter or letters, and his representatives, whether they are literary
letters or letters of business, possess the sole and exclusive copyright
therein; and no person, neither those to whom they are addressed, nor
other persons, have any right or authority to publish the same." But as
manuscripts posthumously published, the copyright in letters may belong to
the receiver or his assigns; and in Macmillan <i>v.</i> Dent, in 1906, the
English Court of Appeal held, where the owners of letters of Charles Lamb
had sold the copyright to certain publishers, these could not be
republished by another who had later bought the material letters even
under the authorization of the representative of Lamb's heirs. In Philip
<i>v.</i> Pennell, Whistler's executrix was denied an injunction to
prevent the use of biographical information obtained from the receivers of
letters. But <i>obiter dicta</i> indicated that the courts may grant to
the writer's representatives an injunction against publication or misuse.
The laws of some countries specifically permit the publication of letters
in the interest of justice. <a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 93]</span>Unless the letter is of the nature of
privileged correspondence, the courts can probably require the production
of a letter in court, and in fact do subp&oelig;na telegraph companies to
produce the originals or transmittal records of telegrams in court, and
thus make them <i>quasi</i> public property. The sale of a manuscript
letter cannot authorize a vendee to publish it without consent of the
writer, and the receiver of a letter is perhaps bound to keep a letter
private or destroy it, if so required by the writer, but this is a right
difficult of enforcement if not doubtful <i>in esse</i>. The receiver of a
letter has probably a right to destroy it at his will, unless the writer
has required its return to him.</p>

<p>The subject-matter of copyright in respect to musical and dramatic
compositions and works of art, is treated specifically in later chapters
on dramatic and musical copyright and on artistic copyright.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="93"></a>Designs patentable</p>

<p>Designs for use in manufacture are, in the United States, subjects of
patent and not copyright. It is provided by the act of May 9, 1902, that
"any new, original, and ornamental design for an article of manufacture"
may be patented, and this classification inferentially excludes such
designs from copyright. This generalized description of design patents
replaced, at the suggestion of the Commissioner of Patents, the specific
descriptions in the design patents act of December 1, 1873, and adopted
instead the more comprehensive phraseology of the act of February 4, 1887,
for the punishment of infringement of design patents. In like manner the
new British code excludes designs registrable under the patents and
designs act, 1907, "except designs which, though capable of being so
registered, are not used or intended to be used as models or patterns to
be multiplied by any industrial process." </p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="94a"></a>Foreign practice</p>

<p><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
94]</span>"The foreign copyright legislation," as is stated in Copyright
Office Bulletin, No. 9 of 1905, "instead of specifically naming the
productions which are subject-matter of copyright, generally uses some
inclusive expression, such as 'all writings,' 'every kind of literary
work,' 'works of literature,' 'literary and scientific works,' 'every
production of literature and science,' and even such inclusive terms as
'every work of the intellect.'" Spain adds the inclusive phrase "produced
or published by ... any kind of impression or reproduction known now or
subsequently invented." Great Britain, most of her colonies, and some
other countries have set forth specific categories. But the new British
measure uses the general phrase "every original literary dramatic musical
and artistic work"&mdash;this replacing the several categories in the
several previous laws. In a few countries manuscripts, personal letters
and telegraphic messages, mostly in newspaper use, and in Ecuador, titles
of periodicals, are specifically scheduled as subjects of copyright.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="94b"></a>International definition</p>

<p>The Berlin convention uses the general expression "literary and
artistic works," which it defines as including "all productions in the
literary, scientific or artistic domain, whatever the mode or form of
reproduction," then specifying in detail categories of literary, dramatic,
musical and other artistic works, as set forth in the chapter on
international conventions and arrangements.</p>

<h3 class="p4">VII</h3>

<h4>OWNERSHIP OF COPYRIGHT: WHO MAY SECURE COPYRIGHT</h4>

<p class="p2 sidenote"><a name="95a"></a>Persons named</p>

<p>The American code of 1909 names (sec. 8) "the author or proprietor of
any work made the subject of copyright by this Act, or his executors,
administrators, or assigns" as the persons in whom the copyright may
lodge. It also provides specifically (sec. 62) that "the word 'author'
shall include an employer in the case of works made for hire."</p>

<p>The American law formerly named "the author, inventor, designer, or
proprietor of any work, and the executors, administrators, or assigns of
any such person" as the persons in whom copyright may lodge. The Librarian
of Congress accordingly issued copyright certificates for books as to an
"author" or "proprietor" only, assuming usually that an editor was the
"author" and a publisher the "proprietor," and never going behind the
claim set forth in the application. Under the new law the applicant is
designated only as the "claimant," and no such distinction is made, except
that the Copyright Office has an index card for proprietor, as well as
author, when another than the author makes the application.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="95b"></a>The author primarily</p>

<p>The author is the person primarily entitled to copyright. He may sell
or otherwise transfer his production before it is copyrighted, in which
case the new proprietor obtains all the common law rights of property,
both in the manuscript and its publication, including the right to
copyright. This common law right, including the right to copyright, may
extend, Drone argues, to the finder of an unpublished manuscript, <a
name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
96]</span>provided no one successfully disputes his ownership of his find,
if the manuscript be copyrightable; but there are no decisions on this
point. If a copyright is taken out by another person (as the publisher of
the book), it is done impliedly in trust for the author, as is a usual
custom among American publishers. The proprietor is defined to mean "the
representative of an artist or author who might himself obtain
copyright."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="96"></a>Claimant's right to register</p>

<p>The Register of Copyrights is not a <i>quasi</i> judicial officer, as
is the Commissioner of Patents, and he does not undertake to make decision
as to the right of the claimant, this question being one for determination
by the courts in specific instances. In cases of doubt, however, he may in
practice, for the sake of convenience and of clearness of record, call the
attention of the claimant to such doubt and invite explanation, but he
probably would not be justified in refusing to register the application
for a claimant who asserted his right to such entry. A former Librarian of
Congress, then directly the copyright officer, used to say that he would
enter copyright for any one on the Bible in King James' version if formal
application were made to him, thus emphasizing the statement that he had
no judicial authority. In the case of Everson <i>v.</i> John Russell
Young, then Librarian of Congress, Judge Cole in 1889, while refusing the
mandamus asked for, asserted incidentally that "the Librarian had no
discretion." Where a second application is made for the entry of the same
copyrightable work by a second party, the copyright officer would not
decline to register the second application, if the claimant insisted on
his right, after the fact of the first registration had been brought to
the second claimant's notice, and the question of ownership would have to
be brought before the courts. It <a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 97]</span>is only in the case of works evidently not
copyrightable, or in the case of claimants not entitled to apply for
registration, as a citizen of a foreign country with which the United
States has no copyright relations, or in other cases evidently beyond the
scope of the law, that the copyright officer would exercise discretion and
decline to make the record.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="97"></a>Employer as author</p>

<p>The provision of the new code specifically including as author (sec.
62) "an employer in the case of works made for hire" is new in American
law, but it adopts previous decisions of the courts. It does not, however,
adjudicate the application or specific definition of this phrase, which
remains in large measure a question of contract. Earlier copyright
decisions were to the effect that the authorship may inhere in the
employer, if the design of the work is so far his as to make him the
virtual creator and the actual writer a deputy merely; but that he is not
an author who "merely suggests the subject, and has no share in the design
or execution of the work." But under the new law, the case turns upon the
meaning of "employment," which would be clear in the case of writers paid
wages or salary for doing the work on an encyclopædia, but might not be
clear in the case of an author paid in advance or on account by a
publisher, though working on a general plan suggested or invented by the
publisher. In such cases the proprietary right, including the right to
secure copyright, depends upon the contract, implied or express, and the
courts will decide this according to the law of contracts. In Boucicault
<i>v.</i> Fox, in 1862, Judge Shipman, in the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court,
held, as to the play "The octoroon," that "a man's intellectual
productions are peculiarly his own, and he will not be deemed to have
parted with his right and transferred it to his employer until a valid
agreement <a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
98]</span>to that effect is adduced." It is safer in all cases, for the
protection of the employer and for the sake of clear relations with the
actual person who does the work, that there should be a definite
contract.</p>

<p>When a salaried law reporter had been employed by the State of New York
under a law that the copyright of the Reports should vest in the State,
Judge Nelson for the Circuit Court of Appeals, in 1852, in Little
<i>v.</i> Gould, held as valid an entry by the Secretary of State, "in
trust for the State of New York," though no formal assignment had been
made.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="98a"></a>Implied ownership</p>

<p>In the absence of specific contract, or even in some cases of specific
contract, many cross-questions may arise which the law does not and cannot
determine in advance. In the case of a book "with illustrations by John
Leech," where Leech retained the copyright of the designs, though the
publishers owned the wood on which he had drawn them, an English court
held to a distinction between the copyright and the right to the material,
and directed the publishers to waive their lesser right and surrender the
blocks, in view of the circumstances of the contract.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="98b"></a>Protection outside of copyright</p>

<p>Most of the cases arising as to ownership are, in fact, issues outside
of copyright law, as when in 1883 in Clemens <i>v.</i> Belford, in the
U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court in Illinois, Samuel L. Clemens vainly sought to
restrain the use of his pen-name, "Mark Twain," in a collection of his
uncopyrighted papers, Judge Blodgett holding that whoever has a right to
publish has a right to state authorship, though an author can restrain the
publication over his name of things he did not write. The same doctrine
was upheld in 1910 in Ellis <i>v.</i> Hurst, where a publisher had printed
with the real name of the author some non-copyright books which Edward S.
Ellis had put forth under a <a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 99]</span>pseudonym. Judge Greenbaum, in the N. Y.
Supreme Court, held that the law insuring right of privacy does not
prevent the use of a writer's name on a book undoubtedly of his
writing.</p>

<p>In 1908 Mr. Clemens sought in vain to prevent the use by others of his
pseudonym, "Mark Twain," by incorporating a company with this name,
planning thus to secure the exclusive use of the name for this corporation
and practically obtaining a continuing trade-mark protection for it under
this device. But that an author may protect a <i>nom de plume</i> of
settled use independent of copyright or trade-mark was held in Landa v.
Greenberg in 1908, in Chancery Division.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="99"></a>Work in cyclopædias</p>

<p>When, as in the case of a cyclopædia, many persons are employed at the
offices of an employer, using his materials and facilities, and especially
if on salary, the courts would undoubtedly uphold his full proprietorship
in their work. Where outside persons contribute special articles, the
presumption would probably be that the ownership of the copyright, for
that special publication, vested in the employer, but that neither he,
without the author's consent, nor the author, without his consent, could
publish the article in other competing shape. In Bullen <i>v.</i> Aflalo,
the House of Lords, in 1903, reversing the lower courts, protected the
proprietors of an encyclopædia who had purchased articles from authors,
against reprints of the material elsewhere, by the authors themselves, on
the ground "that the right to obtain copyright was intended to pass to the
publisher, otherwise he would get nothing from his bargain; and unless the
publisher and proprietor of the encyclopædia stood in the shoes of the
actual writer and was the proprietor of the copyright, he would have
nothing for his money, because the articles might be published by others
and he would have no remedy, not having the copyright." </p>

100]</span>The right of a contributor to have his name associated with his
work in the case of an encyclopædia, at issue in Basil Jones <i>v.</i>
American Law Book Co., where the individual writer's name was replaced by
that of a distinguished jurist, though upheld in 1905 by Judge McCall in
the N. Y. Supreme Court, was denied in the reversal of this decision in
1908 by the Appellate Division through Judge Houghton.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="100b"></a>Added material and alteration</p>

<p>Where a publisher had affixed additional material to a copyrighted
book, the author was denied relief in Holloway <i>v.</i> Bradley, in 1886,
by Judge Butler in the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court; but this decision would
not hold where the added material was so placed as to give the false
impression that it was written by the author of the copyrighted work. Thus
in 1910, in Gilbert <i>v.</i> Workman, Sir W. S. Gilbert obtained an order
in the Chancery Division through Justice Neville against the interpolation
of a song into his copyrighted opera without his consent.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="100c"></a>Separate registration of
contributions</p>

<p>This would hold true to like extent in respect to alterations, which
might be permissible when in the nature of proof-reading correction or
editorial revision, but contrary to equity when they pervert, obscure, or
otherwise misrepresent the author.</p>

<p>In respect to composite works, the new American code indicates (sec.
23) that there may be separate registration of contributions,
inferentially in the person of "an individual author," as distinguished
from the general entry for copyright of the composite work. This doubtless
refers to the practice, for instance, of the entry in his own name of his
specific work, by a novelist or other contributor to a periodical, in
addition to the general entry of the number of the periodical of which it
is a copyrightable component part. The only direct effect is to give to
the specific author <i>prima facie</i> evidence of ownership in his
specific contribution, <a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 101]</span>as distinguished from the right of the
proprietor of the general copyright, and in some respects the clause is
ambiguous and perhaps misleading, making it the more desirable that the
relation of the individual author should be defined by contract. It is not
really in conflict, however, with the principle that there cannot be two
copyrights in the same work, as the evident distinction implied is that
the proprietor of the general copyright holds the right for publication in
the periodical and that the specific author reserves the right of
publication in other form, which distinction is sufficiently provided for
as a matter of contract and does not depend upon specific entry of the
contribution. The wisest course may be for the proprietor of the
periodical or other composite work to reassign his interest in the
specific contribution, as was done by the proprietors of the <i>Smart
Set</i> as adjudicated in the case of Dam <i>v.</i> Kirke La Shelle Co.,
cited in the chapter on dramatic and musical copyright, and thus remove
possible doubt as to ownership.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="101a"></a>Anonymous works</p>

<p>There is no specific reference in the new American code as to anonymous
or pseudonymous works, except as to duration of copyright. In practice,
the Copyright Office assumes that the applicant for the entry of an
anonymous or pseudonymous work is the qualified and legal author or
proprietor, and any disputed question of fact would ultimately be decided
by the courts.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="101b"></a>Joint authorship</p>

<p>There may be joint authorship in a work of common design, in which case
the joint authors will become owners in common of the undivided property;
but mere alterations or work on specific parts could not justify claim to
more than such alterations or parts. The copyright would naturally be
entered in both names, but as one copyright; it was held in <a
name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
102]</span>1902, in Mifflin <i>v.</i> Dutton, by the U.&nbsp;S. Supreme
Court, that "there cannot be duplicate copyrights of the same book in
different names." If one of the joint authors and not the other should
apply for entry, the Copyright Office would in practice probably record
the copyright claim on the presumption that the author was acting in the
common interest; but if two joint authors applied simultaneously and
severally, the question of ownership would have to be settled by the
courts.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="102a"></a>Corporate bodies</p>

<p>A corporate body, even though not incorporated under statute, is
considered an author in the case of its own proceedings or similar
publications, and in 1903 Justice Holmes rendered the decision of the
U.&nbsp;S. Supreme Court in the case of Bleistein <i>v.</i> Donaldson
Lith. Co., though the court was divided on the subject, that a copyright
taken in the name of the Courier Lithographing Company, which was only the
trade name of the complainant, was valid.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="102b"></a>Posthumous works</p>

<p>In the case of posthumous works, the person entitled to copyright would
be the executor, administrator, or the heirs of the author, and the owner
of an unpublished manuscript could probably enter and maintain copyright
in the absence of other legal claimant.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="102c"></a>The Peary cases<br />

Opposing decisions</p>

<p>The first important case under the new American code, in September,
1909, dealt with the question who may obtain copyright. On the report of
the discovery of the North Pole, the New York <i>Herald</i> procured from
Dr. Cook his account of his journey and copyrighted it on its publication
in the <i>Herald</i>,&mdash;which copyright does not seem to have been
questioned. Immediately thereafter came Commander Peary's account of his
polar journey, for which the New York <i>Times</i> had contracted with him
before his departure in the previous year. The Peary report was published
<a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
103]</span>simultaneously by the New York <i>Times</i> and the London
<i>Times</i>, but the difference of five hours enabled the correspondents
of the New York <i>Sun</i> and <i>World</i> to cable the report to their
respective papers in time for publication at the same hour in America as
in the New York <i>Times</i>. Anticipating this course, the New York
<i>Times</i> had taken the precaution to publish the report in pamphlet or
"book" form some hours before newspaper publication, and to copyright this
as a book. When an injunction was asked in the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court
from Judge Hand, that judge granted the injunction, but on the required
production of the contract in court, dissolved his injunction on the
ground that the contract between Peary and the New York <i>Times</i> gave
to the <i>Times</i> only the right to news publication and specifically
reserved to Peary magazine and book rights. He inferred thus that the
<i>Times</i> had no right to copyright the news report as a book, and was
not the agent of the author for that purpose. To the contrary, Judge
Grosscup in Chicago, in an exactly similar case against the Chicago
<i>Inter-Ocean</i> and other Chicago papers, and with the contract before
him, maintained the copyright by the <i>Times</i>. The two contradictory
decisions have not so far been adjudicated in the higher courts. It will
be observed that the question is not strictly one of copyright, but of
contract, and that it is not denied that the news report, in the literary
form given it by the author, was a proper subject of copyright, though the
news of the discovery of the North Pole might not be copyrightable. Judge
Hand perhaps erred in assuming that there could be separate copyright for
news, magazine, or book publication, overlooking the fact that Peary had
conferred on the <i>Times</i> authority to protect the report sent to it
by cable, while reserving to himself rights <a name="Page_104"
id="Page_104"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 104]</span>in magazine or book
publication of his material, whether in the same or different form.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="104a"></a>Renewal rights</p>

<p>In the renewal of copyright, the new American code follows the previous
law in differentiating the persons entitled to renew the copyright. It
provides (sec. 23) that in the case of a posthumous composite or corporate
work originally copyrighted by the proprietor thereof or a work made for
hire, the proprietor of such copyright shall be entitled to a renewal; but
in other cases, including a separately registered contribution by an
individual to a composite work, the author or the widow, widower or
children, or, if such be not living, the author's executors or next of kin
shall be entitled to a renewal. This means that there can be no renewal by
an assignee proprietor, and that in the absence of natural heirs of a
personal author, no person is entitled to a renewal of his copyright. The
new law has been specifically construed to this effect by the
Attorney-General in his opinion of February 3, 1910. It should be noted
that the word "administrators," included in the provision as to original
application (sec. 8), is omitted from the provision as to renewal (sec.
23) including renewal of existing copyrights (sec. 24), indicating that
while an author may make bequest of copyright for the renewal term, which
right may then be claimed by his executor, the right to renew lapses when
he makes no will and has no next of kin to inherit the right of
renewal.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="104b"></a>Assignments</p>

<p>Specific provision as to the method and record of the transfer of
copyrights by assignments are contained in the following provisions of the
code of 1909:</p>

<p>"(Sec. 42.) That copyright secured under this or previous Acts of the
United States may be assigned, granted, or mortgaged by an instrument in
writing signed by the proprietor of the copyright, or may be bequeathed by
will. </p>

<p><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 105]</span>
"(Sec. 43.) That every assignment of copyright executed in a foreign
country shall be acknowledged by the assignor before a consular officer or
secretary of legation of the United States authorized by law to administer
oaths or perform notarial acts. The certificate of such acknowledgment
under the hand and official seal of such consular officer or secretary of
legation shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the execution of the
instrument.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="105a"></a>Assignment record</p>

<p>"(Sec. 44.) That every assignment of copyright shall be recorded in the
copyright office within three calendar months after its execution in the
United States or within six calendar months after its execution without
the limits of the United States, in default of which it shall be void as
against any subsequent purchaser or mortgagee for a valuable
consideration, without notice, whose assignment has been duly
recorded.</p>

<p>"(Sec. 45.) That the register of copyrights shall, upon payment of the
prescribed fee, record such assignment, and shall return it to the sender
with a certificate of record attached under seal of the copyright office,
and upon the payment of the fee prescribed by this Act he shall furnish to
any person requesting the same a certified copy thereof under the said
seal.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="105b"></a>Substitution of name</p>

<p>"(Sec. 46). That when an assignment of the copyright in a specified
book or other work has been recorded the assignee may substitute his name
for that of the assignor in the statutory notice of copyright prescribed
by this Act."</p>

<p>It should be noted that this last provision, authorizing the
substitution of a name, is applicable only to the general copyright in a
work, and not to a divided right; otherwise there would seem to be more
than one copyright in the same work. The Copyright Office will, however,
record assignments of specific <a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 106]</span>or divided rights without reference to this
power of substitution. Further assignment from one assignee to another is
permissible to any extent, and in cases of repeated assignment of a
general copyright there may be further substitution of names.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="106a"></a>Witnesses</p>

<p>There is no specific requirement as to the witnessing of assignments,
which would therefore follow the usual principles of law. This was,
however, an important question in England, and under the early English
statute the courts held that assignments must be in writing, attested by
two witnesses; the later statute of Victoria modified the language, and
the new English code requires assignment in writing signed by the owner or
his authorized agent, without specifying witnesses. But assignment of
common law rights (as in an unpublished manuscript) may doubtless be by
word of mouth.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="106b"></a>"Outrights" and renewal</p>

<p>Where an author sells his entire rights "outright," he cannot transfer
the right to take out renewal, but he may directly or by inference bind
himself to apply for such renewal in the interest of the new proprietor.
Under such a contract, this proprietor could probably require him by
equity proceedings to take this step. Such a contract, however, would not
bar the author from his right to renewal under the copyright law and
through the Copyright Office, although it is possible that the courts
might enjoin an author from renewal or assignment of a renewed copyright
in the interest of another than the original assignee. It should be noted
that in the case of composite, corporate or like impersonal works,
copyrighted under the new code, renewal is not restricted to the
<i>original</i> proprietor, though by analogy this should be the practice;
but that in the case of renewal of copyrights existing before July 1,
1909, and in extension of the present renewal terms, the use of the phrase
"such proprietor," referring <a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 107]</span>back to "the original proprietor," does
make such limitation.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="107a"></a>Proof of proprietorship</p>

<p>Where the copyright proprietor of record is not the author, the courts
may require him to prove his rights, in default of which the copyright
certificate will be adjudged null and void, as was done in 1909 by the
Circuit Court of Appeals both in Bosselman <i>v.</i> Richardson, where a
son copyrighted paintings by his father and failed to prove that they had
not before been published, and in Saake <i>v.</i> Lederer, where the court
canceled the copyright of the play "Old Heidelberg" because Lederer had
obtained from the German author only a license to perform and not a right
to copyright.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="107b"></a>Foreign citizens</p>

<p>As to copyright by others than citizens of the country, the law of 1909
provides (sec. 8) "that the copyright secured by this Act shall extend to
the work of an author or proprietor who is a citizen or subject of a
foreign state or nation, only:</p>

<p>"(a) When an alien author or proprietor shall be domiciled within the
United States at the time of the first publication of his work; or</p>

<p>"(b) When the foreign state or nation of which such author or
proprietor is a citizen or subject grants, either by treaty, convention,
agreement, or law, to citizens of the United States the benefit of
copyright on substantially the same basis as to its own citizens, or
copyright protection substantially equal to the protection secured to such
foreign author under this Act, or by treaty; or when such foreign state or
nation is a party to an international agreement which provides for
reciprocity in the granting of copyright, by the terms of which agreement
the United States may, at its pleasure, become a party thereto.</p>

<p>"The existence of the reciprocal conditions aforesaid shall be
determined by the President of the <a name="Page_108"
id="Page_108"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 108]</span>United States, by
proclamation made from time to time, as the purposes of this Act may
require."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="108a"></a>Earlier provisions</p>

<p>The Revised Statutes formerly extended copyright to "a citizen of the
United States or <i>resident therein</i> or his widow or children," and
the act of 1891 provided for a <i>quasi</i> international copyright on a
basis similar to that in subsection (b), cited above, of the law of 1909,
<i>i. e.</i> on a basis of reciprocity. The new American code practically
adopts the features both of the Revised Statutes and the act of 1891,
though with verbal and substantial differences. The word "domiciled" is
new in the law and has yet to be construed in a copyright case, but it is
presumably the equivalent of "resident." The new Rules and Regulations of
the Copyright Office use the phrase "(2) a resident alien domiciled in the
United States at the time of the first publication of his work."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="108b"></a>Residence</p>

<p>A resident, under the American decisions, is a person who intends to
reside permanently in this country. It is decided by the intention of the
resident. A person who is residing here without intention of permanence
probably cannot maintain copyright under this clause. For English
copyright, on the contrary, a person temporarily residing in His Majesty's
dominions has been considered a resident. "The United States" would
doubtless be construed to include territories and dependencies, as
specific jurisdiction is given (sec. 34) to stated courts in Alaska,
Hawaii, the Philippine Islands and Porto Rico, in addition to the general
decisions of the U.&nbsp;S. Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Under the statute of Anne the English courts differed persistently on
the question whether a non-resident foreigner could obtain British
copyright by first publication within the British dominions, until in
1854, in the ultimate case of Jefferys <i>v.</i> Boosey, the House of
Lords, after consulting the judges, of whom <a name="Page_109"
id="Page_109"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 109]</span>six denied and four
sustained the contention, decided unanimously that a non-resident
foreigner could not acquire copyright by first publication. Under the law
of 1842, the question was again raised, in view of the variation of the
language from that in the statute of Anne; in 1868, in the case of
Routledge <i>v.</i> Low, in which an American author claimed copyright for
his work first published in London while he resided for a few days in
Canada, the House of Lords held that a foreigner might thus obtain
copyright by temporary residence within the British dominions and
indicated, but did not decide, that a foreigner could obtain copyright by
first publication, even if not temporarily resident within the British
dominions. After the passage of the "international copyright amendment" in
1891, the American law authorities consulted with the law officers of the
Crown, who rendered a decision that foreign authors were entitled to
British copyright on the sole condition of first publication, and on this
decision the President based his proclamation of reciprocal relations with
Great Britain. The new British measure retains first publication within
the included parts of the Empire as the essential condition, except in
unpublished works, unless otherwise provided under international
copyright, though the Crown may withdraw this privilege from foreigners
whose countries do not assure reciprocity.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="109a"></a>Intending citizens</p>

<p>The provision of subsection (a) is chiefly useful, it would seem, to
protect intending citizens who have applied for naturalization papers and
incidentally renounced their previous allegiance to another power and thus
put themselves beyond the pale of the international conventions.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="109b"></a>Time of first publication</p>

<p>"First publication" is not limited in terms to the United States, and
the "alien author or proprietor," provided he makes application under this
clause and <a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
110]</span>is not a citizen of a country with which the United States has
a copyright convention, must therefore be domiciled here, it would seem,
at the time of first publication, in whatever country that may be.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="110"></a>Non-qualified authors cannot
transfer</p>

<p>It has twice been decided, both prior to and since the "international
copyright amendment" of 1891, that a foreign author not qualified to
secure a copyright cannot indirectly obtain one by assignment to an
American or other proprietor. In 1890 J. M. Barrie assigned to J. W.
Lovell, and he to the U.&nbsp;S. Book Company, his American rights in "The
little minister," and after the act of 1891 the latter endeavored to
restrain a dramatization of the story. Judge Jenkins held with the lower
court that the foreign author could transfer only, prior to the act, the
right to publish from advance sheets and not the right to copyright. In
the case of Bong <i>v.</i> Campbell Art Co., in which it was sought to
protect under the act of 1891 a work by a Peruvian painter, Hernandez,
whose country had no international relations with the United States,
through transfer to a German proprietor, whose country had reciprocal
relations, it was held in 1909 by the U.&nbsp;S. Supreme Court, through
Justice McKenna, that an author who is a citizen of a country with which
the United States has no copyright relations cannot indirectly obtain
American copyright by making a citizen of a country with which the United
States has copyright relations the proprietor of his work. A proprietor
has been construed by the courts to mean merely an assignee of a qualified
author. It is evident, therefore, despite the ambiguous phrasing of the
statute, that an assignee proprietor, though domiciled in the United
States at the time of first publication of a work, could not obtain
copyright unless the author were so domiciled, for the contrary ruling
would nullify the general purport of <a name="Page_111"
id="Page_111"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 111]</span>the law by
permitting an assignee to acquire rights which the non-qualified author
could not secure. The evident construction of the word "proprietor" in
this clause is as proprietor of an impersonal work and not an assignee
proprietor. The Rules and Regulations of the Copyright Office, construing
the code of 1909, say specifically (2): "If the author of the work should
be a person who could not himself claim the benefit of the copyright act,
the proprietor cannot claim it."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="111a"></a>Foreign ownership</p>

<p>But it seems that a foreigner may enter copyright in the work of a
citizen or resident author&mdash;it being foreign authorship, not
ownership, which the law refuses to protect, though this point has not
been judicially determined. Under the provision (sec. 62) of the new
American code giving copyright to an employer as author "in the case of
works made for hire," it would seem that a person entitled to make
copyright entry might, as an employer, obtain copyright on the work of an
alien employee not domiciled here and not otherwise entitled to enter
copyright; but it is probable that this construction would not extend to a
separate or separable work, as this would be contrary to the principles
adjudicated as above cited.</p>

<p>The complicated question of the ownership and the right to secure
copyright in translations from foreign works or into foreign languages,
under this international copyright provision, is covered under translation
in the preceding chapter on subject-matter of copyright.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="111b"></a>Proclaimed countries</p>

<p>Under the provisions of the international copyright clause of 1891
Presidential proclamations have designated as countries with which the
United States has copyright relations (July 1, 1891) Belgium, France,
Great Britain and her possessions, Switzerland; (April 15, 1892) Germany;
(October 31, 1892) Italy; (May 8, 1893) Denmark; (July 20, 1893) Portugal;

China&mdash;this treaty of October 8, 1903, protecting for ten years
books, maps, prints or engravings "especially prepared for the use and
education of the Chinese people," or "translation into Chinese of any
book," but leaving to Chinese subjects liberty to make "original
translations into Chinese"; (July 1, 1905) Norway; (May 17, 1906)
Japan&mdash;this treaty of November 10, 1905, also excepting translations,
and (August 11, 1908) additionally protecting Japanese relations in China

<p class="sidenote">Under act of 1909</p>

<p>Under the provisions of the act of 1909, the President of the United
States issued a general proclamation, dated April 9, 1910, certifying anew
to the existence of reciprocal relations with the above-mentioned
countries, under the arrangements of the new act, as from its effective
date July 1, 1909. This accepted such relations as continuous and
uninterrupted, without the necessity of new treaties, with the effect that
international copyrights before July 1, 1909, were under the arrangements
of the act of 1891 and from and after that date under the arrangements of
the code of 1909. Luxemburg was added by proclamation of June 29, 1910,
and Sweden by that of May 26, 1911. Proclamations of December 8, 1910, as
to Germany, and June 14, 1911, as to Belgium, Luxemburg and Norway,
proclaimed reciprocal relations as to mechanical reproductions.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="113a"></a>Buenos Aires convention</p>

<p>The ratification of the Buenos Aires convention <a name="Page_113"
id="Page_113"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 113]</span>by the U.&nbsp;S.
Senate, February 16, 1911, has the effect of authorizing the President to
proclaim reciprocal relations with other countries which are parties to
that treaty, as each ratifies the convention.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="113b"></a>The new British code</p>

<p>The new British measure specifies that "the author of a work shall be
the first owner of the copyright," except where an engraving, photograph,
or portrait is ordered for valuable consideration or where work is done in
the course of employment. The owner may assign the copyright in writing,
"either wholly or partially, and either generally or subject to
limitations to any particular country, and either for the whole term of
the copyright or for any part thereof, and may grant any interest in the
right by license"; in case of partial assignment, the original owner and
the assignee become respectively the owners of the residual and assigned
portions of the copyright. But any assignment, except by will, becomes
null and void twenty-five years after the death of the author when the
entire rights revert to his heirs.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="113c"></a>Foreign practice</p>

<p>In general the statutes of most of the copyright countries designate
"authors" and their "assigns and heirs" as the persons who may obtain
copyright. The Australian law of 1905 defines "author" to include "the
personal representatives of an author." In certain countries the laws
specifically mention as persons who may secure copyright "joint authors,"
"proprietors" in some countries and "publishers" in other countries of
anonymous and pseudonymous, posthumous or unpublished works, periodicals
and composite works, "corporate bodies," "translators," "editors,
compilers or adapters" and "persons who give a commission for a portrait
or photograph."</p>

<h4>DURATION OF COPYRIGHT: TERM AND RENEWAL</h4>

<p class="p2 sidenote"><a name="114a"></a>Historic precedent</p>

<p>The duration of copyright was in the early printers' privileges for a
short term, as for seven years, except in France, where copyrights were in
perpetuity until the act of the National Assembly; in modern times the
copyright term has been lengthened until a term extending through and
beyond the life of the author has been adopted by thirty-seven countries,
or more than half of those which have copyright laws, of which four assure
perpetual copyright. The Constitution imposes only one limitation on the
comprehensive rights of authors, in the provision that protection shall be
"for limited times" only. This provision has made the discussion of
perpetual copyright purely academic in this country. The new American code
adopts the double term of twenty-eight and twenty-eight years, making
fifty-six years in all, without reference to the life of the author.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="114b"></a>Previous American practice</p>

<p>The American law previous to 1909 provided for a uniform term of
twenty-eight years, dating from the time of recording the title, with a
renewal of fourteen years, securable only by the author, or, if he be dead
at the expiration of the term, by his widow or children. No other heirs or
persons could renew. The new code differs in making the renewal period a
second twenty-eight years and extending the right of renewal to the
executors or next of kin and to the proprietors of composite or other
impersonal works; but it still denies renewal to assignee proprietors of
personal works. </p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="115a"></a>Term in code of 1909</p>

<p><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
115]</span>The American code of 1909 provides (sec. 23) "that the
copyright secured by this Act shall endure for twenty-eight years from the
date of first publication, whether the copyrighted work bears the author's
true name or is published anonymously or under an assumed name," and makes
provision also in the cases specified for renewal for a second period of
twenty-eight years, provided that renewal application is registered in the
Copyright Office "within one year prior to the expiration of the original
term of copyright."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="115b"></a>Renewal</p>

<p>The provisions as to renewal are in full as follows (sec. 23):
"<i>Provided</i>, That in the case of any posthumous work or of any
periodical, cyclopædic, or other composite work upon which the copyright
was originally secured by the proprietor thereof, or of any work
copyrighted by a corporate body (otherwise than as assignee or licensee of
the individual author) or by an employer for whom such work is made for
hire, the proprietor of such copyright shall be entitled to a renewal and
extension of the copyright in such work for the further term of
twenty-eight years when application for such renewal and extension shall
have been made to the copyright office and duly registered therein within
one year prior to the expiration of the original term of copyright: <i>And
provided further</i>, That in the case of any other copyrighted work,
including a contribution by an individual author to a periodical or to a
cyclopædic or other composite work when such contribution has been
separately registered, the author of such work, if still living, or the
widow, widower or children of the author, if the author be not living, or
if such author, widow, widower, or children be not living, then the
author's executors, or in the absence of a will, his next of kin shall be
entitled to a renewal and extension of the <a name="Page_116"
id="Page_116"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 116]</span>copyright in such
work for a further term of twenty-eight years when application for such
renewal and extension shall have been made to the copyright office and
duly registered therein within one year prior to the expiration of the
original term of copyright: <i>And provided further</i>, That in default
of the registration of such application for renewal and extension, the
copyright in any work shall determine at the expiration of twenty-eight
years from first publication."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="116a"></a>Extension of subsisting
copyrights</p>

<p>The extension of copyrights subsisting July 1, 1909, is provided for as
follows (sec. 24): "That the copyright subsisting in any work at the time
when this Act goes into effect may, at the expiration of the term provided
for under existing law, be renewed and extended by the author of such work
if still living, or the widow, widower, or children of the author, if the
author be not living, or if such author, widow, widower, or children be
not living, then by the author's executors, or in the absence of a will,
his next of kin, for a further period such that the entire term shall be
equal to that secured by this Act, including the renewal period:
<i>Provided, however</i>, That if the work be a composite work upon which
copyright was originally secured by the proprietor thereof, then such
proprietor shall be entitled to the privilege of renewal and extension
granted under this section: <i>Provided</i>, That application for such
renewal and extension shall be made to the copyright office and duly
registered therein within one year prior to the expiration of the existing
term."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="116b"></a>Assignee of unpublished
manuscripts</p>

<p>In holding with the Attorney-General that an assignee cannot obtain
renewal, Judge Brown in the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court in Rhode Island, in
White Smith <i>v.</i> Goff, in 1910, raised but did not decide the
"difficult" question whether, if an author sells his unpublished
manuscript with right to publish and copyright, <a name="Page_117"
id="Page_117"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 117]</span>the new owner as
the original copyright proprietor may claim renewal, or whether the author
might reclaim the right.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="117a"></a>Extension of subsisting
renewals</p>

<p>Under the provisions of the renewal clauses (sec. 24), not only may the
original copyright term of a subsisting copyright be renewed for the
longer term of twenty-eight years instead of fourteen years, but a
subsisting copyright renewal may be extended from the added fourteen years
to the full renewal term of twenty-eight years, and a separate application
form for this latter class of cases is provided by the Copyright
Office.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="117b"></a>Publishers' equities</p>

<p>In the copyright conferences, it was pointed out by publishers that the
right of the author to renewal, and the implied denial of that right to an
assignee proprietor, placed at serious disadvantage a publisher who had
made investment in plates of an author's works, and would be deprived of
the use of his investment at the end of the original term in case the
author preferred to make arrangements with another publisher for the
renewal term. The Congressional Committee failed, however, to provide a
remedy for this through the proposed Monroe-Smith amendment, requiring
that in such case author and publisher should unite in the application for
renewal. No contract on the part of an author can give a publisher the
right to claim copyright renewal under the new code, although a contract
to make claim for the renewal period and transfer the copyright for the
renewal period to the publisher, might be enforced by the courts through a
writ requiring the author to enter such claim and assign the renewed
copyright in accordance with the contract. When a copyrighted work is sold
"outright," it therefore does not include renewal of the copyright, and
unless the author registers his renewal claim, the right to renewal
lapses. </p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="118a"></a>Estoppel of renewal</p>

<p><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
118]</span>Where an author has sold "outright" all his right, title and
interest in his work, it is possible that this may estop him from
application for renewal or invalidate a renewal, but this question must be
decided by the courts when a case arises. It is important that any
contract between author and publisher should be clear and specific on this
vexed question of rights for the renewal term. No provision is made for
notification of renewal in the copyright notice, and therefore, after the
expiration of the original term, information must be sought from the
Copyright Office as to whether there has been renewal extension of the
term. As it would be hazardous to omit the original copyright notice or to
replace it by one giving the date of renewal, which might be construed to
involve claim of a longer term and thus defeat itself, it may prove the
wiser course to add to the official original notice, the unofficial notice
"Copyright renewed, 19__."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="118b"></a>Life term and beyond</p>

<p>The international copyright convention, as modified at the Berlin
conference of 1908, adopted the term of life and fifty
years,&mdash;previously in force in France and fourteen other
countries,&mdash;subject to adoption by domestic legislation. A term of
life and a specified number of years after the death of the author,
preferably fifty years for personal works, and a term of fifty years for
impersonal works, was advocated by the American Copyright leagues and
other friends of copyright and was in the early drafts of the new
copyright code.</p>

<p>It was pointed out that Emerson, Longfellow, Lowell, Whittier, Holmes
and others outlived their earlier copyrights; that Edward Everett Hale,
whose "Man without a country" did for this nation a patriotic service
scarcely second to that of the great generals of the civil war, had no
longer copyright in this work, although private soldiers, their relicts
and descendants, <a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 119]</span>were still paid pensions; and that many
others of our foremost authors had been, or under the present system would
be, deprived of their created property within their lifetime. The term
advocated provides for the author and his children's children during the
probable minority of the grandchildren, a period to which the entail of
realty is limited by our laws. But the final decision of the Congressional
Committees was for the simpler, though in other respects less
satisfactory, period of twenty-eight years, as heretofore, with a renewal
period of a second twenty-eight years, under the limitations above cited.
No other countries, except Canada and Newfoundland, following our example,
have this double or renewal term.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="119a"></a>Unpublished works</p>

<p>As a lecture or other work intended for oral delivery or a dramatic or
musical work or a work of art, an unpublished dramatic or musical work or
a work of art not reproduced in copies for sale is copyrightable without
reference to date of publication, it is not altogether certain whether the
term extends from the date of registration or the date of first delivery,
performance or exhibition, or whether the statutory law now protects such
a work under common law as unpublished, pending publication and therefore
for an indefinite period if not practically in perpetuity. The Copyright
Office issues a certificate for twenty-eight years, but without reference
to initial date, which would be presumably the date of the certificate.
The Copyright Office will doubtless, under this precedent, issue renewal
certificate for the second term of twenty-eight years.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="119b"></a>Publication as date of
copyright</p>

<p>As the new copyright code makes publication with notice the basis of
copyright instead of entry and deposit, as formerly, the term of copyright
now dates from publication, and "the date of publication" is specifically
defined (sec. 62) as "the earliest date <a name="Page_120"
id="Page_120"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 120]</span>when copies of the
first authorized edition were placed on sale, sold, or publicly
distributed by the proprietor of the copyright or under his authority."
Such date is included in the application for registry at the Copyright
Office, and on the same day twenty-eight years or fifty-six years
thereafter the copyright ends. A provision for terminating copyrights at
the end of the calendar year of expiration was included in the early
drafts of the code, but was not included in the law as enacted.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="120a"></a>Serial publication</p>

<p>In the case of works published and copyrighted as serials, as a novel
published in parts in a monthly magazine, the copyright runs technically
from the first publication of each part; and at the end of the
twenty-eight or fifty-six years, each part could be successively published
at monthly intervals free from copyright. Practically, however, such a
copyrighted serial could not be published complete until twenty-eight or
fifty-six years from the publication of the last part. In usual practice a
novel is printed in book form a month or two before its completion as a
serial in a magazine, and the date of the copyright on the completed work
would then terminate at the end of the twenty-eight or fifty-six years
from publication in book form.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="120b"></a>Joint authorship</p>

<p>The use of the date of publication as the beginning of the copyright
term and the specification of twenty-eight years and twenty-eight years
for its duration, obviates questions as to anonymous and pseudonymous
works, composite works or works of joint authorship. The earlier drafts of
the bill, providing for a term through and beyond life, made the lifetime
of the last surviving author the basis for the term of copyright on works
of joint authorship. This method was interestingly applied in the German
courts, when it was held as to the opera "Carmen" that Bizet's <a
name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
121]</span>music was out of copyright, but that the libretto was protected
because one of its three joint authors was still living.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="121a"></a>Termination by forfeiture or
laches</p>

<p>A copyright is terminated <i>ipse facto</i> by forfeiture as provided
in the act, either because of failure to deposit copies after notice from
the Copyright Office (sec. 13), or because of false affidavit of American
manufacture (sec. 17). It may also be terminated by <i>laches</i>, that
is, carelessness in protecting one's rights, as by omission of the notice,
unless by accident or mistake, from particular copies (sec. 20).</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="121b"></a>Abandonment</p>

<p>A copyright may be terminated by voluntary abandonment or purposed
dedication as well as by expiration, forfeiture or <i>laches</i>. Thus in
1854 Congress purchased for $10,000 the copyright of Sumner's new method
of ascertaining a ship's position, dedicated the method to general public
use, and extinguished the copyright. The Copyright Office has no authority
to recognize annulments, but it has noted request for annulment when
received on the registry. In 1910 the Oxford University Press, American
Branch, formally notified the Treasury Department that they abandoned the
copyright on Oxford Cyclopædic Concordance copyrighted by them in 1903,
and collectors of customs were accordingly authorized by circular letter
of January 25, 1910, to permit importation "of any copies of the said work
with the notice of the copyright obliterated, or a notice of the
abandonment of the copyright plainly printed upon the same page with the
notice of copyright and adjacent thereto." This last was a curious
"boomerang" effect of the manufacturing clause as extended to binding in
the act of 1909.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="121c"></a>In England</p>

<p>In England the term of book copyright has been the life of the author
and seven years after his death, or forty-two years from first
publication, whichever <a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 122]</span>the longer. The copyright in other articles
has varied according to specific laws. The Copyright Commission of 1876
proposed, for all copyright articles as well as books, a term of life and
thirty years after the author's death, according to the German precedent,
or in case of anonymous and posthumous books and encyclopædias, thirty
years from the date of deposit in the British Museum, an anonymous author
to have the right during the thirty years to obtain the full term by
publishing an edition with his name. The English law contained a specific
provision that in the case of articles in periodicals (but not in an
encyclopædia) the right to publish in separate form should revert to an
author after twenty-eight years; the Commission proposed a term of three
years, during which time also the author as well as the general owner may
bring suit against piracy. The English committee appointed to make
recommendations in respect to the adoption of the Berlin provisions of
1908 through domestic legislation, however, reported strongly in favor of
a general term of life and fifty years; and this term has been adopted in
the new code.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="122"></a>The new British code</p>

<p>This general term of "the life of the author and a period of fifty
years after his death" holds "unless previously determined by first
publication elsewhere." In joint authorship, copyright shall subsist
during the life of the author who first dies and fifty years after or
during the life of the author who dies last, whichever the longer. In
posthumous works, copyright subsists for fifty years from first
publication or performance, whichever the earlier. Anonymous and
pseudonymous, and corporate works are not named in the act, and the term
is presumably fifty years, unless in the former cases identity is
disclosed. For photographs and mechanical music reproductions as such, the
term is fifty years from the making of the original <a name="Page_123"
id="Page_123"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 123]</span>negative or the
original plate. Existing copyrights are extended through the new period;
but for the extended term the rights revert to the author, though an
assignee may require continuance of the assignment or continue to publish
on royalties, as determined by agreement or arbitration. Assignments,
except for parts of collective works, terminate in twenty-five years, when
rights revert to the heirs.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="123"></a>Perpetual copyright</p>

<p>The Crown has held an exclusive and perpetual right to license the
printing of the Bible, Book of Common Prayer, ordnance surveys, and
possibly the Acts of Parliament; and specified universities and colleges
were assured perpetual copyright in works given or bequeathed to them
unless given for a limited term, but the right lapsed into the usual
copyright term unless the work were printed on their own presses and for
their own benefit. Under the new code, "without prejudice to any rights or
privileges of the Crown," any work prepared or published for His Majesty
or any Government department has copyright for fifty years from first
publication&mdash;the effect of which provision on Crown perpetual
copyrights is not clearly evident. A saving clause protects the
universities "in any right they already possess," inferentially limiting
their future copyrights to the statutory term. After the death of the
author of a literary, dramatic or musical work, on complaint of the
withholding of the work from publication or performance, the Judicial
Committee of the Privy Council may require the owner to grant a license to
reproduce or perform the work in public under conditions determined by the
Committee. After twenty-five years, or in the case of existing copyrights
thirty years from the author's death, the work may be reproduced by any
person on prescribed notice in writing of his intention and payment of ten
per cent on the published <a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 124]</span>price in accordance with regulations by the
Board of Trade.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="124a"></a>Other countries<br />

<a name="124b"></a>International standard term</p>

<p>Perpetual copyright is granted by the laws of other countries, Mexico,
Guatemala, Nicaragua and Venezuela, while in Montenegro, Egypt, Liberia,
Honduras, the Dominican Republic, Paraguay and Uruguay, which give
copyright protection without specific legislation under a crude civil or
common law enforced by the courts, the term is indefinite. A copyright
term extending eighty years beyond the death of the author is granted by
Spain, Cuba, Colombia and Panama. The French precedent of fifty years
after the author's death was followed by Belgium, Russia and the
Scandinavian countries, Hungary, Portugal and some others, and was adopted
by the Berlin convention as the international standard term; the German
precedent of thirty years beyond death was followed by Austria,
Switzerland and Japan, while the British precedent of seven years beyond
death or forty-two years from publication, whichever the longer, was
followed in many of the English colonies and in Siam. Italy has a curious
term of life or at least forty years after publication, with a second
period of forty years during which, though the exclusive rights lapse, the
author enjoys a royalty of five per cent on publication price. Haiti has
the curious term of the life of the author and twenty additional years for
widow or children, or ten years for other heirs. In Holland fifty years or
life, in Brazil fifty years from the preceding January 1st, and in Greece
fifteen years are specified.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="124c"></a>Special categories</p>

<p>In many countries there are special terms for special categories of
works, as for anonymous, pseudonymous, and corporate works, translations,
photographs and telegraphic dispatches&mdash;the latter for a stated
number of hours.</p>

<h4>FORMALITIES OF COPYRIGHT: PUBLICATION, NOTICE, REGISTRATION AND
DEPOSIT</h4>

<p class="p2 sidenote"><a name="125a"></a>General principles</p>

<p>Copyright may inhere as a natural right, as under English common law
before the statute of Anne, without record or formalities, but also
without statutory protection; or formalities may be required only as a
prerequisite to protection by actions at law; or formalities may be
required to validate and secure the copyright. English formalities belong
to the second class. American formalities are of the third class, and
without them copyright does not exist.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="125b"></a>Previous American requirements</p>

<p>The American copyright law of 1909 prescribes exactly the method of
securing copyright, and makes clear the cases in which non-compliance
invalidates copyright. Previous to 1909 copyright was secured by complying
exactly with the statutory requirements of (1) the delivery to the
Librarian of Congress on or before the day of publication, in this or any
foreign country, of a printed (including typewritten) copy of title or
description of the work, (2) the insertion in every copy published of the
prescribed copyright notice, and (3) the deposit not later (under the law
of 1891) than such day of publication (earlier law allowing ten days after
publication) of two copies of the best edition of a book or other article,
or a photograph of a work of art (as to date of deposit of which last the
law was not explicit); and any failure to comply literally and exactly
with these conditions forfeited the copyright.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="126a"></a>Present American basis</p>

<p>The American code of 1909 substitutes an entirely different basis for
securing copyright. Copyright <a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 126]</span>now depends upon (1) publication with the
notice of copyright, and (2) deposit of copies, these copies in the case
of books and certain other works to be manufactured within the United
States. The accidental omission of the copyright notice from "a particular
copy or copies" does not invalidate the copyright though it may relieve an
innocent trespasser from penalty as an infringer; but failure to deposit
within a specified time, or false report as to manufacture, makes the
copyright not valid.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="126b"></a>Provisions of 1909</p>

<p>The general provisions as to formalities are as follows (sec. 9): "That
any person entitled thereto by this Act may secure copyright for his work
by publication thereof with the notice of copyright required by this Act;
and such notice shall be affixed to each copy thereof published or offered
for sale in the United States by authority of the copyright proprietor,
except in the case of books seeking <i>ad interim</i> protection under
section twenty-one of this Act"; and (sec. 10): "That such person may
obtain registration of his claim to copyright by complying with the
provisions of this Act, including the deposit of copies, and upon such
compliance the Register of Copyrights shall issue to him the certificate
provided for in section fifty-five of this Act."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="126c"></a>Publication</p>

<p>The definition in the act (sec. 62) of "the date of publication" as
"the earliest date when copies of the first authorized edition were placed
on sale, sold, or publicly distributed by the proprietor of the copyright
or under his authority" defines publication, and the clause (sec. 9)
requiring the copyright notice to be affixed to each copy "published or
offered for sale in the United States by authority of the copyright
proprietor" confirms the principle that the copyright proprietor cannot be
held responsible, nor can copyright be voided because of copies
"published," offered, <a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 127]</span>sold or distributed without his authority.
The Copyright Office Rules and Regulations (23) add to the definition of
publication the parenthetical explanation: "(<i>i. e.</i>, so that all
persons who desire copies may obtain them without restriction or condition
other than that imposed by the copyright law)." It is questionable,
however, whether this explanation does not go beyond the letter of the
law. In Stern <i>v.</i> Remick, in 1910, the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court
protected the copyright of a song, though only one copy had been offered
for sale and sold. Advance distribution to the trade or of review copies
would not constitute publication. While the law does not prescribe first
publication in this country, it is at least doubtful whether a book
published in another country prior to publication here, unless protected
by international copyright relations, has not fallen into the public
domain and thus forfeited copyright protection here.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="127"></a>Copyright notice</p>

<p>The first step in securing copyright, being publication "with the
notice of copyright" "affixed to each copy published or offered for sale
in the United States by authority of the copyright proprietor," the method
and form of this notice is of first importance. The act of 1909 provides
(sec. 18): "That the notice of copyright required by section nine of this
Act shall consist either of the word 'Copyright' or the abbreviation
'Copr.,' accompanied by the name of the copyright proprietor, and if the
work be a printed literary, musical, or dramatic work, the notice shall
include also the year in which the copyright was secured by publication.
In the case, however, of copies of works specified in subsections (f) to
(k), inclusive, of section five of this Act, the notice may consist of the
letter C inclosed within a circle, thus: ©, accompanied by the initials,
monogram, mark, or symbol of the copyright proprietor: <i>Provided</i>,
That on some accessible <a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 128]</span>portion of such copies or of the margin,
back, permanent base, or pedestal, or of the substance on which such
copies shall be mounted, his name shall appear. But in the case of works
in which copyright is subsisting when this Act shall go into effect, the
notice of copyright may be either in one of the forms prescribed herein or
in one of those prescribed by the Act of June eighteenth, eighteen hundred
and seventy-four."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="128a"></a>Previous statutory form</p>

<p>Under the law of 1874, the prescribed notice was in the old form (Rev.
Stat. 4962), "Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year ____, by
A. B., in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington," with
the optional alternative of the form "Copyright, 18__, by A. B." Under the
new code the latter form is preserved, with the alternative of the
provision "Copr.," with date and name, but the longer form may be used on
books copyrighted under the earlier acts, even if reprinted after the
passage of the later act. Except for books previously copyrighted, the
longer form is not now the legal notice, and its use would be dangerous,
as it does not contain the specific word copyright, or its abbreviation,
now made an obligatory part of the notice. While in Osgood v. Aloe in
1897, the omission of the name from the notice, though on the title-page,
and in Record &amp; Guide Co. <i>v.</i> Bromley in 1910, the omission of
the date, though indicated by the date of the periodical in the line
below, were held to void the copyright, such addition as the words
"published by" has been held, as in Hills v. Hoover in 1905, a mere
superfluity not voiding copyright.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="128b"></a>Exact phraseology required</p>

<p>The exact phraseology and order of words must be followed, and it has
been held that any inaccuracy in the name of the copyright proprietor, as
in the English case of Low <i>v.</i> Routledge, by Vice-Chancellor
Kindersley, <a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
129]</span>in 1864, or in the date of the entry, as in the American case
of Baker <i>v.</i> Taylor in 1848, when 1847 was put for 1846, makes the
copyright invalid.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="129a"></a>Name</p>

<p>The name in the copyright notice (C. O. Rule 24) must be the real name
of a living person or of a firm or corporate body or the trade name in
actual use, and may not be a pseudonym or pen-name or other make-believe.
A copyright notice should not be in the name of one person for the benefit
of another; the beneficiary's name should be the one printed. A publisher
may take out a copyright for an author, however, in which case the
publisher's name and not the author's name will be given, unless the
publisher makes application as the agent of the author-claimant. The name
in the copyright notice must correspond fully with the real name as given
in the application, but an objection that N. Sarony instead of Napoleon
Sarony was not the real name, was quashed in 1884, in Burrow-Giles Lith.
Co. <i>v.</i> Sarony, by the U.&nbsp;S. Supreme Court.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="129b"></a>Date</p>

<p>The date of copyright notice, being that of publication, should
correspond with the imprint date on the original edition; but on later
printings or editions, where the date of imprint is changed, the copyright
notice would of course show the earlier date of the original edition. Thus
a book first published in 1911 could not bear copyright notice of 1910
date, which would mean that copyright was registered before instead of
after publication, which is not possible under the new law; nor should an
edition of 1910 bear copyright notice of 1911, as the application and
notice should state the actual year of publication; and the date of 1911
in imprint where the copyright notice is of 1910, would be correct only on
a later edition, as above stated. A book may be printed, however, in a
certain year and not published till a later year, in which case the
copyright notice would be of later <a name="Page_130"
id="Page_130"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 130]</span>date than the
imprint date; thus the Copyright Office registered in 1910, under the new
law, a copyright on a work with the imprint of 1904, on assurance that
though printed in 1904, the work was not actually published until 1910.
Under the old law, where, as stated above, a copyright notice later than
the actual copyright was disallowed as claiming protection beyond the
copyright term, a later decision, in 1888, in Callaghan <i>v.</i> Myers,
held, that where a copyright notice gave the year 1866, while the true
date was 1867, there was no harm done to the public, because a year of the
copyright, which really ended in 1895 instead of 1894, was given to the
public, whereas in the previous case an additional year was claimed. Doubt
was thrown upon this decision by Judge Wallace in Schumacher <i>v.</i>
Wogram, also in 1888. In Snow <i>v.</i> Mast in 1895, the substitution for
1894 of the abbreviated '94, and in Stern <i>v.</i> Remick in 1910, the
use of words or Roman numerals for Arabic, were upheld.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="130"></a>Accidental omission</p>

<p>An important safeguard, new in copyright law, is enacted in the
provision (sec. 20): "That where the copyright proprietor has sought to
comply with the provisions of this Act with respect to notice, the
omission by accident or mistake of the prescribed notice from a particular
copy or copies shall not invalidate the copyright or prevent recovery for
infringement against any person who, after actual notice of the copyright,
begins an undertaking to infringe it, but shall prevent the recovery of
damages against an innocent infringer who has been misled by the omission
of the notice; and in a suit for infringement no permanent injunction
shall be had unless the copyright proprietor shall reimburse to the
innocent infringer his reasonable outlay innocently incurred if the court,
in its discretion, shall so direct."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="131a"></a>Place of notice</p>

<p>It is further provided (sec. 19): "That the notice <a name="Page_131"
id="Page_131"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 131]</span>of copyright shall
be applied, in the case of a book or other printed publication, upon its
title-page or the page immediately following, or if a periodical either
upon the title-page or upon the first page of text of each separate number
or under the title heading, or if a musical work either upon its
title-page or the first page of music: <i>Provided</i>, That one notice of
copyright in each volume or in each number of a newspaper or periodical
published shall suffice."</p>

<p>Although the code of 1909 relieves the copyright proprietor from
permanent forfeiture in the case of an accidental omission of the
copyright notice from certain copies (sec. 20), the statute is otherwise
specific, and there seems to be no means of relief where the copyright
notice is, however innocently, in the wrong place or in the wrong form.
Thus in 1909, in Freeman <i>v.</i> Trade Register, the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit
Court held that where the copyright notice of a periodical appeared on the
editorial page, which was not the first page of text, the copyright was
voided. The copyright notice can probably, however, be placed safely and
preferably on the first page, being the title-page, of a specially
copyrighted part of a book, as an introduction preceding a non-copyright
work or an index or appended notes, or upon specific illustrations; and
this is perhaps preferable in copyrighting editions with such features of
works otherwise in the public domain. In the case of articles in a
periodical or parts of a composite work separately copyrighted or
registered, the copyright notice should appear on the same page as the
title heading.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="131b"></a>One notice sufficient</p>

<p>The proviso (sec. 19) that one notice of copyright in each volume or in
each number of a periodical shall suffice is complementary to the
provision (sec. 3) by which a copyright protects all the copyrightable
component parts of the work copyrighted, and gives to <a name="Page_132"
id="Page_132"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 132]</span>the proprietor of a
composite work or periodical all the rights he would have if each part
were individually copyrighted. It means that there need be no repetition
of the general copyright notice on different portions of a book or
periodical. In West Pub. Co. <i>v.</i> Thompson Co., under the old law,
Judge Ward, in the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1910, overruled
the defense that the copyright was not valid because the copyright notice
did not repeat the several copyright notices originally protecting the
several parts of the compilation; and this view, that the general
copyright notice protects all copyrighted and copyrightable parts, is now
specifically embodied in the statute.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="132"></a>Separate volumes<br />

<a name="133a"></a>Different dates</p>

<p>The proviso (sec. 61) "that only one registration at one fee shall be
required in the case of several volumes of the same book deposited at the
same time" indicates that one copyright entry suffices for several volumes
simultaneously published, but each separate volume should contain the
notice. Volumes published separately, not only in successive years but at
successive dates within the year, should be separately registered, and if
published separately in successive years, must each bear its copyright
notice for the year of publication&mdash;this being the direct sequence
from the provision that copyright runs from the specific date of
publication and not from the year or date of registration. The Copyright
Office will, however, under the law, register for one fee volumes or parts
deposited at the same time, though published at various times. In the case
of a book issued in successive parts, of which only the first part
includes a title-page or title headings, the law is not specific; but it
seems probable that, in default of copyright notice and registration for
each part, the parts not bearing copyright notice might be legally
reprinted, and that the safer course is to place the copyright notice on
the <a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
133]</span>first page of each part and register each part separately, in
which case the completed work should have the date or dates of the year or
years within which the several parts were published. There seem to be no
objections, within the law or from court decisions, to coupling two dates
in the same notice, in such cases as "Copyright, 1910, 1911, by A. B.,"
though there is no specific decision on this point. Under the previous law
a book published in more than one volume or part, the portions not
complete in themselves, was probably protected by copyright entry of the
first part, all parts being of course ultimately deposited; but the change
in the new code basing copyright on publication with notice, seems to
change this rule of practice. In the case of Dwight <i>v.</i> Appleton, in
1840, it was held that as the statute did not expressly prescribe that the
copyright notice should appear in successive volumes after the first, this
was not necessary; but the application of this doubtful decision under the
new code would be more than questionable.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Notice part of initial step</p>

<p>It may be emphasized that publication with notice is the first step in
copyright under the new code, and that registration on deposit is the
secondary and completing act, and therefore that no registry in the
Copyright Office is necessary to authorize the printing of the copyright
notice, as was formerly the case.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="133b"></a>Extraterritorial notice</p>

<p>The requirement (sec. 9) that the notice of copyright "shall be affixed
to each copy published or offered for sale in the United States by
authority of the copyright proprietor" makes clear what was a subject of
dispute under the old law. The courts, however, generally held that
extraterritorial notice of copyright, <i>i. e.</i> on foreign editions,
was impracticable and unnecessary; and this view is specifically adopted
in the new code. In 1905, in Harper <i>v.</i> Donohue, it was held by
Judge Sanborn, in the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court, <a name="Page_134"
id="Page_134"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 134]</span>that the omission
of the American copyright notice from an English edition could not vitiate
copyright here, especially in view of the prohibition in the law of the
importation of foreign-made copies of copyright works. In 1908, in Merriam
<i>v.</i> United Dictionary Co., it was held by the U.&nbsp;S. Supreme
Court, through Justice Holmes, that even where the omission of the notice
on a foreign-made edition was with the assent of the American copyright
proprietor, there was no waiver of copyright in this country.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="134a"></a>Successive editions</p>

<p>In the case of successive printings or editions of a copyrighted book,
the original copyright entry must appear in every reprint of the first
edition; and it would seem that this entry should also appear in every new
edition newly copyrighted, as well as the new notice, so long as it is
desired to protect the matter contained in the old edition. Judge
Clifford, in the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court, in Lawrence <i>v.</i> Dana, in
1869, ruled this to be superfluous; but his decision is contrary to the
rule that a proprietor may not claim through the copyright notice a longer
term than the law permits, since a later date, referring only to new
matter, but apparently comprehensive of the whole contents, might be
voided under this rule. It is doubtful whether on a new edition with old
and new matter one copyright notice with two dates is safe, and the wiser
course is to give both the earlier copyright notice and the later notice
in proper sequence. In the case of new printings of works published and
copyrighted prior to July 1, 1909, no new notice or application is
required unless there is added material to be additionally protected and
constituting to that extent a new work, in which case a new application
and the deposit of two copies is necessary.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="134b"></a>False copyright notice</p>

<p>Provision is specifically made against false notice of copyright by the
enactment (sec. 29): "That any <a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 135]</span>person who, with fraudulent intent, shall
insert or impress any notice of copyright required by this Act, or words
of the same purport, in or upon any uncopyrighted article, or with
fraudulent intent shall remove or alter the copyright notice upon any
article duly copyrighted shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a
fine of not less than one hundred dollars and not more than one thousand
dollars. Any person who shall knowingly issue or sell any article bearing
a notice of United States copyright which has not been copyrighted in this
country, or who shall knowingly import any article bearing such notice or
words of the same purport, which has not been copyrighted in this country,
shall be liable to a fine of one hundred dollars," and the importation of
any article bearing a notice of copyright when no American copyright
exists is absolutely prohibited (sec. 30).</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="135a"></a>Ad interim protection</p>

<p>It should be noted that the copyright notice is not required on books
published abroad in the English language before publication in this
country, entered for <i>ad interim</i> copyright, and therefore that
within sixty days after the publication abroad of a book in the English
language, such book may be protected by American registration, though
containing no notice of copyright; and within this period inquiry at the
Copyright Office is necessary to determine the status of the book.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="135b"></a>Substitution of name</p>

<p>It is provided (sec. 46): "That when an assignment of the copyright in
a specified book or other work has been recorded the assignee may
substitute his name for that of the assignor in the statutory notice of
copyright prescribed by this Act." This applies only where the entire
copyright has been assigned and the assignment duly recorded in the
Copyright Office as provided by law, and does not permit a change of name
in the copyright notice under any other circumstances, <a name="Page_136"
id="Page_136"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 136]</span>as partial
assignment. Substitution without authority of law voids copyright, as was
held in Record &amp; Guide Co. <i>v.</i> Bromley in 1910, where another
trade name of the copyright claimant was substituted for the original
trade name.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="136a"></a>Registration</p>

<p>The method of registration, or rather of application therefor, is not
specified in the law, for the reason that under the code of 1909 deposit
succeeding publication is made the act completing the securing of
copyright, and registration is incidental thereto instead of the first
requisite. Under the old law it was decided in the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit
Court through Judge Colt, in Gottsberger <i>v.</i> Estes, that publication
before deposit of copies voided the copyright.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="136b"></a>Rules and regulations</p>

<p>The act provides (sec. 53): "That, subject to the approval of the
Librarian of Congress, the Register of Copyrights shall be authorized to
make rules and regulations for the registration of claims to copyright as
provided by this Act," and (sec. 54) "whenever deposit has been made in
the Copyright Office of a copy of any work under the provisions of this
Act, he shall make entry thereof."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="136c"></a>Application</p>

<p>It is provided (sec. 5): "That the application for registration shall
specify to which of the [stated] classes the work in which copyright is
claimed belongs," but it is also provided "nor shall any error in
classification invalidate or impair the copyright protection." In Green
<i>v.</i> Luby, in 1909, the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court protected a
vaudeville sketch, though classified as a dramatic instead of a
dramatico-musical copyright, against infringement by a mimic
performance.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="136d"></a>Certificate</p>

<p>It is further provided (sec. 55): "That in the case of each entry the
person recorded as the claimant of the copyright shall be entitled to a
certificate of registration under seal of the Copyright Office, to contain
his name and address, the title of the work <a name="Page_137"
id="Page_137"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 137]</span>upon which
copyright is claimed, the date of the deposit of the copies of such work,
and such marks as to class designation and entry number as shall fully
identify the entry. In the case of a book the certificate shall also state
the receipt of the affidavit as provided by section sixteen of this Act,
the date of the completion of the printing, or the date of the publication
of the book, as stated in the said affidavit. The Register of Copyrights
shall prepare a printed form for the said certificate, to be filled out in
each case as above provided for, which certificate, sealed with the seal
of the Copyright Office, shall, upon payment of the prescribed fee, be
given to any person making application for the same, and the said
certificate shall be admitted in any court as <i>prima facie</i> evidence
of the facts stated therein. In addition to such certificate the Register
of Copyrights shall furnish, upon request, without additional fee, a
receipt for the copies of the work deposited to complete the
registration."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="137"></a>Application requirements</p>

<p>The application is in general in simple form, and care should be taken
in filling out the card that the space at the top intended for use by the
Copyright Office should be left blank. The application must be signed with
the name and address of the copyright claimant, who may be the author or
his representative, as where his publisher is taking out the copyright. In
the case of works made for hire, the employer may make application as
author. The name of the author should be given on the line provided for
that purpose, even though the name of the author as claimant is also given
above; but in the case of anonymous or pseudonymous works, the name of the
author is not required. The title should be given exactly as on the
title-page of the book or on the work, and the other particulars called
for in the application should <a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 138]</span>be exactly as indicated by the work itself.
The day of publication must be exactly stated, and the application cannot
be made, therefore, until <i>after</i> publication. Provision is also made
on the card for the name and address of the person to whom the certificate
of registration is to be sent and of the remitter of the fee, and in the
case of books, the application must be accompanied by the affidavit made
either on the reverse of the application card or on the separate card also
provided. In applications, as for foreign or <i>ad interim</i> copyright,
where the nationality of the author should be stated, information as to
citizenship, not race, is required. A person naturalized in the United
States is defined as an American. A foreign author claiming copyright
because of residence, must state that he is a "permanent resident" of the
United States (C. O. Rule 29).</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="138a"></a>Illustrations</p>

<p>The illustrations of a book may be separately registered, and if by
lithographic or photo-engraving process must also have affidavit of
manufacture in this country.</p>

<p>Maps and charts are classed with works of art, and the formalities in
respect to these, as well as in respect to dramatic and musical
compositions, are treated specifically in the chapters on those specific
subjects.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="138b"></a>Periodicals</p>

<p>In respect to periodicals, application should be made as for books, but
no affidavit is required; separate registration is necessary for each
number published, with notice of copyright, and can be made only after
publication. It is not possible to register the title of the periodical in
advance of publication. (C. O. Rule 36.) Two deposit copies of periodicals
are required; but a contribution to a periodical separately registered
requires the deposit of only one copy of the periodical. The entire copy
should be sent, as <a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 139]</span>a mere clipping does not comply with the
statute. (C. O. Rule 37.) The date of publication of a periodical is not
necessarily the printed date of issue, and the actual day of publication
should be stated in the application, whether for the registration of the
periodical itself or a contribution to it.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="139"></a>Application cards</p>

<p>The Copyright Office has prepared blank forms in library card shape,
which are furnished applicants free of charge, for the several classes of
applications mentioned in the law, the cards being in <i>pink</i>, except
as hereafter stated, lettered and numbered as follows: (A<sup><span
class="tinier">1</span></sup>) book by citizen or resident of the United
States; (A<sup><span class="tinier">1</span></sup>. New ed.) new edition
of book by citizen or resident of the United States; (A<sup><span
class="tinier">1</span></sup> for.) book by citizen or resident of a
foreign country, but manufactured in the United States; (A<sup><span
class="tinier">2</span></sup>) edition printed in the United States of
book originally published abroad in the English language, all these being
double cards including affidavit of American
manufacture&mdash;supplemented by <i>blue</i> cards providing with
specific instructions, (A<sup><span class="tinier">1</span></sup>) for
separate affidavit of American manufacture from type set or plates made in
the United States, and (A<sup><span class="tinier">2</span></sup>) for
lithographic or photo-engraving process within the United States;
(A<sup><span class="tinier">3</span></sup>) book by foreign author in
foreign language; (A<sup><span class="tinier">4</span></sup>) <i>ad
interim</i> copyright&mdash;book published abroad in the English language;
(A<sup><span class="tinier">5</span></sup>) contribution to a newspaper or
periodical; (B<sup><span class="tinier">1</span></sup>)
periodical,&mdash;for registration of single issue; (B<sup><span
class="tinier">2</span></sup>) periodical,&mdash;general application and
deposit, supplemented by a <i>white</i> blank for depositing single
subsequent issues; (C) lecture, sermon, or address prepared for oral
delivery; (D<sup><span class="tinier">1</span></sup>) published dramatic
composition; (D<sup><span class="tinier">2</span></sup>) dramatic
composition not reproduced for sale; (D<sup><span
class="tinier">3</span></sup>) dramatico-musical composition; (E<sup><span
class="tinier">1</span></sup>) published musical composition; (E<sup><span
class="tinier">2</span></sup>) musical composition not reproduced for
sale&mdash;these <a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 140]</span>supplemented by a <i>blue</i> card
(<i>U</i>), notice of use on mechanical instruments; (F) published map;
(G) work of art (painting, drawing, or sculpture), or model or design for
a work of art; (H) reproduction of a work of art; (I) drawing or plastic
work of a scientific or technical character; (J<sup><span
class="tinier">1</span></sup>) photograph published for sale; (J<sup><span
class="tinier">2</span></sup>) photograph not reproduced for sale; (K)
print or pictorial illustration; (R<sup><span
class="tinier">1</span></sup>) renewal of copyright subsisting in any
work; (R<sup><span class="tinier">2</span></sup>) extension of a renewal
copyright subsisting in any work. Thus an applicant for copyright on an
American book should send for card (A<sup><span
class="tinier">1</span></sup>), on which he may enter his application and
also include affidavit as to American type setting, printing, and binding;
if he wishes the affidavit to be separately made he should obtain also the
special <i>blue</i> card (<i>A</i><sup><span
class="tinier">1</span></sup>), or if lithographic or photo-engraving is
used he should obtain also the special <i>blue</i> card
(<i>A</i><sup><span class="tinier">2</span></sup>). A dramatic applicant
should send for card (D<sup><span class="tinier">1</span></sup>) or card
(D<sup><span class="tinier">3</span></sup>), respectively, for the entry
of a dramatic or dramatico-musical composition; or for (D<sup><span
class="tinier">2</span></sup>) if he desires to copyright without
reproducing for sale. The applicant for a musical composition, as
distinguished from a dramatico-musical work, should send for card
(E<sup><span class="tinier">1</span></sup>) or (E<sup><span
class="tinier">2</span></sup>) respectively. The art applicant should send
for card (G) for an original work of art, or card (H) for a reproduction,
or for a photograph card (J<sup><span class="tinier">1</span></sup>) or
card (J<sup><span class="tinier">2</span></sup>) respectively.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="140"></a>Certificate cards</p>

<p>Similar certificate cards, also of library size, uniformly
<i>white</i>, are provided for the several classes of registration,
correspondingly lettered and numbered, except in a few cases where one
certificate form serves for more than one class or subdivision, with the
addition of a general form (Z) to cover anything unprovided for in the
other certificate forms. The certificate bears on one side the uniform
statement of the deposit of two copies or one copy of the article <a
name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
141]</span>named herein, and of registration for the first or renewal
term, with the name of the claimant (printed in the case of a few of the
publishers making most applications), and on the other side the
specification (following the wording of the application and the deposit
copy) of the title or description, date of publication, receipt of
affidavit (where required), receipt of copies and entry number by class,
together with the seal of the Copyright Office.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="141"></a>Fees</p>

<p>This certificate is sent without charge other than the fees directly
provided for in the law (sec. 61), viz., "for the registration of any work
subject to copyright, deposited under provisions of this Act, one dollar,
which sum is to include a certificate of registration under seal:
<i>Provided</i>, That in the case of photographs the fee shall be fifty
cents where a certificate is not demanded. For every additional
certificate of registration made, fifty cents.... For recording the
extension or renewal of copyright provided for in sections twenty-three
and twenty-four of this Act, fifty cents." The law no longer contemplates
record before publication, and it is unnecessary and undesirable to send
application or money previous to sending of deposit copies. In fact, as
the certificate must show date of publication, publication <i>cannot</i>
be anticipated, and money sent in advance, for individual registrations,
is only an embarrassment to the Copyright Office. The Office will,
however, receive advance deposits from publishers of periodicals or other
publishers making frequent registrations, against which each registration
will be charged. Fees should be sent by money order, or at the remitter's
risk, in currency (but not in stamps). Bank drafts and certified checks
are accepted in practice, though the Register of Copyrights cannot legally
receive checks except at his personal risk and therefore from persons <a
name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
142]</span>known to him as in frequent relation with the Copyright Office.
Postage must be prepaid on the signed application, as there is no
provision for free transmission through the mails, such as applies to
deposit copies. In practice the application with remittance and the
deposit copies should be simultaneously sent immediately after
publication.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="142"></a>Deposit</p>

<p>The law provides that deposit copies shall be sent <i>promptly</i>
after publication, and that <i>two complete</i> copies of the <i>best</i>
edition then published (or one copy in case of a contribution to a
periodical or for identification of a work not reproduced for sale) shall
be deposited; and if a work is published with notice of copyright, and
copies are not promptly deposited, the copyright is voided and the
proprietor becomes subject to penalty three months (or in case of outlying
possessions or foreign countries six months) after formal demand by the
Register of Copyrights for deposit copies. The word "promptly" is
indefinite and has been vaguely construed to mean "without unnecessary
delay," but this does not mean the very day of publication (C. O. Rule
22). The status of undeposited works published with copyright notice and
not formally demanded by the Register of Copyrights, is also not defined
by the law. In such case the copyright has not been perfected by the
completing act, and it would be impracticable to proceed against an
infringer, and the proprietor might be liable to penalty for false notice
of copyright. In the event of such a case arising, through carelessness or
otherwise, the courts would have to decide the question by definition of
the word "promptly" and an interpretation of the implication that
copyright is voided, meaning that the right to obtain copyright lapses, if
the process is not completed without undue delay.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="143a"></a>Fragment not depositable</p>

<p>The deposit copy must be the complete work; a <a name="Page_143"
id="Page_143"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 143]</span>fragment is not a
work, and a part of a work cannot be copyrighted, especially as this would
nullify the manufacturing clause, as set forth in the opinion of the
Attorney-General, February 9, 1910.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="143b"></a>Typewriting publication and
deposit</p>

<p>A work may be published and deposited in typewriting copies, as set
forth in the opinion of the Attorney-General of May 2, 1910, but this will
not operate to avoid the manufacturing clause when the work is published
in print.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="143c"></a>Legal provisions</p>

<p>The completion of the copyright by deposit of copies is covered by the
provision (sec. 12): "That after copyright has been secured by publication
of the work with the notice of copyright as provided in section nine of
this Act, there shall be promptly deposited in the Copyright Office or in
the mail addressed to the Register of Copyrights, Washington, District of
Columbia, two complete copies of the best edition thereof then published,
which copies, if the work be a book or periodical, shall have been
produced in accordance with the manufacturing provisions specified in
section fifteen of this Act; or if such work be a contribution to a
periodical, for which contribution special registration is requested, one
copy of the issue or issues containing such contribution; or if the work
is not reproduced in copies for sale, there shall be deposited the copy,
print, photograph, or other identifying reproduction provided by section
eleven of this Act, such copies or copy, print, photograph, or other
reproduction to be accompanied in each case by a claim of copyright. No
action or proceeding shall be maintained for infringement of copyright in
any work until the provisions of this Act with respect to the deposit of
copies and registration of such work shall have been complied with."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="144a"></a>Voiding by failure to deposit</p>

<p>In case of failure to deposit, the law of 1909 provides for penalties
and finally voiding of the copyright, <a name="Page_144"
id="Page_144"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 144]</span>as follows (sec.
13): "That should the copies called for by section twelve of this Act not
be promptly deposited as herein provided, the Register of Copyrights may
at any time after the publication of the work, upon actual notice, require
the proprietor of the copyright to deposit them, and after the said demand
shall have been made, in default of the deposit copies of the work within
three months from any part of the United States, except an outlying
territorial possession of the United States, or within six months from any
outlying territorial possession of the United States, or from any foreign
country, the proprietor of the copyright shall be liable to a fine of one
hundred dollars and to pay to the Library of Congress twice the amount of
the retail price of the best edition of the work, and the copyright shall
become void."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="144b"></a>Forfeiture by false affidavit</p>

<p>In the case of a printed book or periodical or of a lithograph or
photo-engraving, the copies deposited must be manufactured in America, as
set forth in the manufacturing provision (sec. 15) as verified in the case
of a book by affidavit (sec. 16) separately treated hereafter, and the
book copyright is forfeited (sec. 17) in the event of false affidavit.
Thus failure to deposit, and, in the case of books, false affidavit as to
American manufacture, are the two lapses of formalities which work
forfeiture of copyright.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="144c"></a>Works not reproduced</p>

<p>In the case of works not reproduced for sale, copyright may be secured
under the provision (sec. 11): "That copyright may also be had of the
works of an author of which copies are not reproduced for sale, by the
deposit, with claim of copyright, of one complete copy of such work if it
be a lecture or similar production or a dramatic or musical composition;
of a photographic print if the work be a photograph; of a photograph or
other identifying reproduction <a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 145]</span>thereof if it be a work of art or a plastic
work or drawing. But the privilege of registration of copyright secured
hereunder shall not exempt the copyright proprietor from the deposit
copies under sections twelve and thirteen of this Act where the work is
later reproduced in copies for sale." The entire work should in each case
be deposited (C. O. Rule 18) and not a mere outline, epitome or scenario;
and the copy should be in convenient form, clean and legible, with the
leaves securely fastened together, and should bear the title of the work
exactly as given in the application.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="145a"></a>Second registration</p>

<p>It should be noted that in this class of copyright, which is a common
law copyright fortified by statutory protection, an ideal example of
copyright law, double registration is required in case the unpublished
copyrighted work is published, requiring one application fee and deposit
of one identifying copy for the unpublished work and a second application
fee and deposit of two copies promptly after publication.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="145b"></a>Free transportation in mail</p>

<p>It should be noted that the deposit copies may be deposited either in
the Copyright Office or "in the mail addressed to the register of
copyrights," and it is provided (sec. 14): "That the postmaster to whom
are delivered the articles deposited as provided in sections eleven and
twelve of this Act shall, if requested, give a receipt therefor and shall
mail them to their destination without cost to the copyright claimant."
Franking labels are not required and are no longer issued by the Copyright
Office. Deposit copies, and all mail matter, should be addressed to the
"Register of Copyrights, Library of Congress, Washington, D. C.," and not
to any person by name.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="145c"></a>Loss in mail</p>

<p>Thus even if the deposit copies should not reach Washington, as in case
they were burned in the mail, <a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 146]</span>the copyright proprietor can validate his
claim by production of the postmaster's receipt in lieu of deposit
copies.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="146a"></a>Foreign works</p>

<p>In respect to foreign works, it should be noted that "the original text
of a work of foreign origin in a language or languages other than
English," may be formally copyrighted and fully protected by registration
under the same formalities as domestic works except that the deposit
copies need not be manufactured within the United States, thus giving the
author the exclusive right of translation. Copies published for use in
America must of course bear the copyright notice. A translation into
English from such text cannot be copyrighted unless the deposit copies of
the English translation are manufactured within the United States; and
this holds true also in respect to translations into a language other than
English, as it is only "the original text" which can be copyrighted
without American manufacture.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="146b"></a>Ad interim deposit</p>

<p>In respect to books published abroad in the English language, <i>ad
interim</i> protection is assured by the provision (sec. 21): "That in the
case of a book published abroad in the English language before publication
in this country, the deposit in the Copyright Office, not later than
thirty days after its publication abroad, of one complete copy of the
foreign edition, with a request for the reservation of the copyright and a
statement of the name and nationality of the author and of the copyright
proprietor and of the date of publication of the said book, shall secure
to the author or proprietor an <i>ad interim</i> copyright, which shall
have all the force and effect given to copyright by this Act, and shall
endure until the expiration of thirty days after such deposit in the
Copyright Office."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="147"></a>Completion of ad interim
copyright</p>

<p>On such works the provisional copyright is made permanent under the
provision (sec. 22): "That <a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 147]</span>whenever within the period of such <i>ad
interim</i> protection an authorized edition of such book shall be
published within the United States, in accordance with the manufacturing
provisions specified in section fifteen of this Act, and whenever the
provisions of this Act as to deposit of copies, registration, filing of
affidavit, and the printing of the copyright notice shall have been duly
complied with, the copyright shall be extended to endure in such book for
the full term elsewhere provided in this Act."</p>

<p>The <i>ad interim</i> provision requires the same formalities and fee
as in the case of domestic works, except that only one copy of the foreign
work in English need be deposited, and that this deposit copy need not
contain the statutory notice of American copyright. The claimant is given
thirty days after publication abroad in which to request reservation and a
second thirty days after deposit of the foreign copy within which to
publish or cause to be published an edition manufactured in America and
thus to complete his copyright. This gives a period of <i>ad interim</i>
protection, ranging from thirty days to sixty days, within which to obtain
permanent copyright, the exact period depending upon the number of days
elapsing after publication before deposit of the foreign copy in the
Copyright Office. Thus a copy deposited on the day of publication will
have thirty days in all within which to secure permanent copyright by the
publication of the American-made edition, while a copy deposited on the
thirtieth day after publication will have sixty days in all; but the
failure to deposit the foreign copy within thirty days after publication,
or the failure to publish an American-made edition within thirty days
after such deposit, will forfeit the right to obtain copyright protection
and throw the foreign work into the public domain, <a name="Page_148"
id="Page_148"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 148]</span>despite the <i>ad
interim</i> registration. When an American-made edition with notice of
copyright can be published in America simultaneously with its publication
abroad, <i>ad interim</i> protection is of course rendered unnecessary;
and such simultaneous publication is the simplest and best practice for
publishers to adopt.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="148a"></a>Omission of copyright notice</p>

<p>It may also be emphasized here that the notice of copyright can be
omitted only from foreign-made copies and must be included in the
American-made edition. The American publisher desiring to reprint a book
published abroad in the English language within sixty days after
publication, without consent of the copyright proprietor, must therefore
assure himself, by inquiry from the Copyright Office, whether the work has
been registered <i>ad interim</i>. The printing of an American copyright
notice on the foreign edition in anticipation of the publication of an
American-made edition and the deposit of copies thereof within the
statutory requirements is a questionable practice, as a failure to publish
American-made copies in the United States, because of defective publishing
arrangements or a printers' or binders' strike, would make such notice a
false notice of copyright. The copyright term in the case of such foreign
work in the English language dates, it would seem, from the date of
publication abroad rather than from the date of publication of the
American-made edition; but this would be of importance only toward the
expiration of the original term and in connection with the renewal
term.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="148b"></a>Books only ad interim</p>

<p><i>Ad interim</i> protection seems to be confined exclusively to a book
as such, and therefore does not apply to articles in periodicals.</p>

<p class="sidenote">American authors not thus protected</p>

<p>It should be noted that an American author publishing his work abroad
is not benefited by either of these provisions respecting foreign works.
The provision <a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 149]</span>regarding works in other languages is
specifically confined to a work of foreign origin, that is, not by an
American author; and he gains nothing, if his work is in English, from
<i>ad interim</i> protection. Thus an American author publishing his work
first in German in Berlin, must copyright and deposit an American-made
edition of his German text in this country to obtain American protection,
without which his work in German could be imported into this country
without his consent, and an independent translation of his text into
English and its publication in America could not be prevented.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="149"></a>Exact conformity required in
formalities</p>

<p>In view of the exact prescription of the method of securing copyright,
unless the statute is precisely complied with the copyright is not valid.
Said Judge Sawyer, in 1875, in Parkinson <i>v.</i> Laselle: "There is no
possible room for construction here. The statute says no right shall
attach until these acts have been performed; and the court cannot say, in
the face of this express negative provision, that a right shall attach
unless they are performed. Until the performance as prescribed, there is
no right acquired under the statute that can be violated." And in the case
of the play "Shaughraun," Boucicault <i>v.</i> Hart, in 1875, Justice Hunt
held, as regards copyrights in general: "Two acts are by the statute made
necessary to be performed, and we can no more take it upon ourselves to
say that the latter is not an indispensable requisite to a copyright than
we can say it of the former." The Supreme Court laid down this general
doctrine in Wheaton <i>v.</i> Peters, in reference to the statutes of 1790
and 1802, and the later statutes are most explicit on this point. In the
same case of Wheaton <i>v</i>. Peters, Justice McLean, in delivering the
judgment of the Supreme Court, held that while the right "accrues," so
that it may be protected in <a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 150]</span>chancery, on compliance with the first
requirement of the prescribed process, it must be perfected by complying
with the other requisites before a suit at law for violation of copyright
can be maintained.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="150a"></a>Expunging from registry</p>

<p>A false or unjustifiable entry of copyright may be expunged from the
registry by court order, as was done in the English case <i>Re</i> Share
Certificate Book in 1908.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="150b"></a>British formalities</p>

<p>The statutory formalities of copyright in other countries vary greatly.
In Great Britain copyright has been secured by first (or simultaneous)
publication within the British dominions or under the "international
copyright act." The law provided that a copy of the best edition of a book
must be deposited in the British Museum, this giving basis for proof of
publication, which deposit must be made within one month after publication
if published within London, three months elsewhere in the United Kingdom,
and one year in other parts of the British dominions; the failure to
deposit did not forfeit copyright, but involved a fine; but under the
international copyright provisions, deposit in the British Museum of a
colonial or foreign work was not required, though useful as <i>prima
facie</i> evidence of publication. Four other copies of domestic books
must be supplied to the universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh and
Dublin if demanded within twelve months from publication. Registration at
Stationers' Hall was necessary for books only as a prerequisite to an
action at law against infringement, but was obligatory in the case of
paintings, drawings and photographs. Copyright notice on a book was not
required except to reserve the right of representation of a dramatic work,
etc., though it has been customary for English publishers to print the
phrase "All rights reserved" as the equivalent to the copyright notice.
But copyright notice was required <a name="Page_151"
id="Page_151"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 151]</span>to protect
sculpture, engravings and musical compositions and in respect to oral
lectures.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="151a"></a>The new British code</p>

<p>The new British code bases copyright for all published works on first
publication within "the parts of His Majesty's dominions to which this Act
extends" or as provided for in colonial or international
arrangements&mdash;copyright of unpublished works depending upon British
citizenship or residence at the time of making. Delivery of copies to the
British Museum and on demand to the other libraries is required from the
publisher of every book published in the United Kingdom, but on penalty of
five pounds and the value of the book and not of forfeiture of copyright.
The National Library of Wales is entitled to a sixth copy, in prescribed
classes of books. Registration is no longer made a condition or
circumstance of copyright.</p>

<p>Most of the British colonies have followed the precedent of the mother
country, with slight variation, in their domestic legislation. Canada and
Newfoundland, following the precedent of the United States, require
copyright notice in statutory form.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="151b"></a>Other countries</p>

<p>France requires deposit of two copies upon publication, and
registration is required prior to a suit for infringement. Germany
requires the registration of the name of the author of anonymous or
pseudonymous works as the condition for copyright, but otherwise grants
copyright practically as natural right without requiring formalities. The
greater number of copyright countries do not impose any formalities except
for specific privileges as the right of translation, of representation or
of reproduction in the case of periodical contributions; or for special
subjects as works of art, musical compositions, telegraphic messages,
where these are protected, and oral lectures. Deposit of copies is,
however, generally required, <a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 152]</span>either before putting the book on the
market or before circulation, or upon publication, or else within a
specified time after publication, ranging from ten days in the case of
Greece to two years in the case of Brazil, while in several countries no
specific time is mentioned. In Italy, if no deposit of a registered work
is made within ten years, the copyright is considered to be abandoned. The
number of copies required varies in the several countries from one to six.
In some countries specific formalities are required to establish the
beginning of the term of protection for collective or posthumous works,
etc., or in connection with the disclosure of the author's name on
anonymous or pseudonymous works. Spain, Colombia and Panama, and Costa
Rica have a curious provision that if a work is not registered within one
year from publication the copyright is forfeited for ten years, at the end
of which period it may be recovered by registration. Canada and
Newfoundland, following the United States precedent, Australia, Holland
and the Dutch colonies, and Siam require manufacture within the country.
In several countries penalty for failure to deposit is provided, the limit
being usually the value of a book and a sum not exceeding £5, or in France
300 francs. The deposit of a photograph or sketch of a work of art is in
many countries required for purposes of identification.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="152"></a>International provisions</p>

<p>International copyright throughout the countries of the International
Copyright Union and the Pan American Union, if the Berlin and Buenos Aires
conventions are ratified throughout, will depend, as now it depends for
most countries, entirely on the formalities in the country of origin.</p>

<h4>THE AMERICAN MANUFACTURING PROVISIONS</h4>

<p class="p2 sidenote"><a name="153a"></a>Manufacturing provision of
1891</p>

<p>In the American law of 1891, embodying the "international copyright
amendment" which for the first time permitted the copyright in the United
States of works by foreign authors not resident in this country, the
copyright of books was conditioned on the manufacture within the United
States, and this condition was made applicable also to American
authors.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="153b"></a>Text in 1909 code</p>

<p>The American code of 1909 follows this precedent in making manufacture
within the United States a <i>sine qua non</i> of copyright for printed
books and periodicals, lithographs and photo-engravings, under the
following provision (sec. 15), commonly cited as the manufacturing
provision: "That of the printed book or periodical specified in section
five, subsections (a) and (b) of this Act, except the original text of a
book of foreign origin in a language or languages other than English, the
text of all copies accorded protection under this Act, except as below
provided, shall be printed from type set within the limits of the United
States, either by hand or by the aid of any kind of type-setting machine,
or from plates made within the limits of the United States from type set
therein, or, if the text be produced by lithographic process, or
photo-engraving process, then by a process wholly performed within the
limits of the United States, and the printing of the text and binding of
the said book shall be performed within the limits of the United States;
which requirements shall extend also to the illustrations within a book
consisting of <a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 154]</span>printed text and illustrations produced by
lithographic process, or photo-engraving process, and also to separate
lithographs or photo-engravings, except where in either case the subjects
represented are located in a foreign country and illustrate a scientific
work or reproduce a work of art; but they shall not apply to works in
raised characters for the use of the blind, or to books of foreign origin
in a language or languages other than English, or to books published
abroad in the English language seeking <i>ad interim</i> protection under
this Act."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="154a"></a>Scope and exceptions</p>

<p>This manufacturing provision requires that every "book" except the
original text of a book of foreign origin, <i>i. e.</i>, not by an
American writer in a language or languages other than English, or a book
published abroad in the English language seeking <i>ad interim</i>
protection, or a book in raised characters for the use of the blind, can
obtain American copyright whether by an American or foreign author, only
in case the type is set, the plates made and lithographic or
photo-engraving text or illustrations produced and the work printed and
bound within the limits of the United States&mdash;inclusive, presumably,
of the outlying dependencies. The provision extends to periodicals, though
these are not subjected to the affidavit clause, and periodicals
containing authorized copyrighted material are not prohibited from
importation. The provisions extend also to lithographs or
photo-engravings, issued separately as well as for book illustration,
unless these represent foreign subjects or illustrate a scientific work or
reproduce a work of art.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="154b"></a>Changes 1891-1909</p>

<p>The provision of 1909 differs from the provision of 1891 in requiring
that a book should be from plates type-set as well as made, and be printed
and bound, within the United States, in adding periodicals and by omitting
photographs and dropping the word <a name="Page_155"
id="Page_155"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 155]</span>chromo, and
including photo-engravings as well as lithographs. The inclusion of
binding in the manufacturing provision met with especial opposition, on
the ground that binding is not an integral part of, but an incidental
addition to, a completed book.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="155a"></a>German-American instances</p>

<p>The effect of these provisions, to cite specific instances, is that an
original German text by a non-American author is exempt from the
manufacturing provisions, but that a French translation or an English
translation is not, and that an original German work by an American author
must be manufactured in this country to obtain protection, and that the
American author printing his work in English abroad may claim <i>ad
interim</i> protection but can obtain no substantial benefit from it. In
case a German-American citizen, or German resident of this country, writes
a book in the German language and prints it first in Berlin, he can have
no American copyright in the German edition; and if copies of such an
edition, without copyright notice, should reach the United States previous
to manufacture and publication of the work here, any one would have the
right to reprint print it, and the work would be practically dedicated to
the public, while the copyright notice could not be affixed to such
foreign printed edition without violation of the law. If, however, the
German work were a translation made by or for the author of a work written
in English, the general copyright of the English work would cover the
German edition, but the German copies could not then be imported.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="155b"></a>Dramas excepted</p>

<p>A drama copyrightable as such under subsection (d) is not subject to
the manufacturing provision, unless classified as a book under subsection
(a). A printed drama was held not to be subject as a book to the
manufacturing provision in Hervieu <i>v.</i> Ogilvie, in the U.&nbsp;S.
Circuit Court, by Judge Martin <a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 156]</span>in 1909, and this decision under the old
law is applicable to the new code.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="156a"></a>Exception of foreign original
texts</p>

<p>The exception of "the original text of a book of foreign origin in a
language or languages other than English,"&mdash;drafted by the author of
the present volume, introduced at the instance of the American (Authors)
Copyright League, as the McCall bill with the assent of the
representatives of the typographical unions responsible for the
manufacturing provision,&mdash;was included to assure a real reciprocity
in copyright with continental and other non-English nations. The exception
is repeated toward the close of the section in the somewhat wider phrase
"books of foreign origin in a language or languages other than English,"
which omits restriction to "the original text"; but it is probable that
the second phrasing would be construed in conformity with the first, as
the evident intention of the law.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="156b"></a>Exception of foreign illustrative
subjects</p>

<p>The exception from lithographs and photo-engravings of subjects which
"are located in a foreign country and illustrate a scientific work or
reproduce a work of art" is intended to permit the importation, either
separately or for book use, of direct reproductions made abroad of scenes
or objects which otherwise could be reproduced in this country only
indirectly and at second-hand; the confusing and probably careless use of
the word "and" might seem to exclude from the exemption a lithograph or
photo-engraving of a natural scene, illustrating a work of travel, but the
courts might here feel justified in taking the more liberal view.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="156c"></a>Affidavit requirement</p>

<p>To the manufacturing provision of the previous law has been added a new
affidavit requirement (sec. 16) as follows:</p>

<p>"That in the case of the book the copies so deposited shall be
accompanied by an affidavit, under <a name="Page_157"
id="Page_157"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 157]</span>the official seal
of any officer authorized to administer oaths within the United States,
duly made by the person claiming copyright or by his duly authorized agent
or representative residing in the United States, or by the printer who has
printed the book, setting forth that the copies deposited have been
printed from type set within the limits of the United States or from
plates made within the limits of the United States from type set therein;
or, if the text be produced by lithographic process, or photo-engraving
process, that such process was wholly performed within the limits of the
United States, and that the printing of the text and binding of the said
book have also been performed within the limits of the United States. Such
affidavit shall state also the place where and the establishment or
establishments in which such type was set or plates were made or
lithographic process, or photo-engraving process or printing and binding
were performed and the date of the completion of the printing of the book
or the date of publication."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="157"></a>Avoidance of errors</p>

<p>In preparing the affidavit, which is necessary for books only, the
applicant should be careful to note the following points, as to which
errors are commonly made. The affidavit should correspond exactly with the
application (as that with the title-page or other data in the work
itself). The affidavit cannot be made till <i>after</i> publication and
must state the exact day of publication or the date of completion, either
or both, which last means not necessarily the completion of printing the
whole edition, but of the deposit copies. The affidavit must be taken and
signed by an individual, not by a corporation, company or firm as such,
and the affiant must state whether he is the claimant, agent of the
claimant, or printer, striking out the other designations. The name of the
printer <a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
158]</span>and binder must be given in the affidavit with city and state
(but not street) address; but this means the printing and binding
establishment and not the individual type-setter or binder. If the book is
not bound but only issued in paper, the word "unbound" should be written
into the affidavit. It is necessary to give the <i>venue</i>, that is, the
county and state in which the affidavit is made, and to take the oath
before a notary or other official authorized to take such oath in that
locality (not merely a justice of the peace). The affiant's and notary's
names should be signed exactly as written into the body of the affidavit,
and the seal should correspond exactly with the name of the official and
the <i>venue</i>. The signature of the affiant and of the notary and the
seal are all necessary to validate the affidavit. The names and other
writing should be written plainly, and the affiant should make sure to
read the affidavit and compare it with the application and with the
book.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="158a"></a>Forfeiture by false affidavit</p>

<p>In case of false affidavit, forfeiture of copyright is provided (sec.
17) as follows:</p>

<p>"That any person who, for the purpose of obtaining registration of a
claim to copyright, shall knowingly make a false affidavit as to his
having complied with the above conditions shall be deemed guilty of a
misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine of
not more than one thousand dollars, and all of his rights and privileges
under said copyright shall thereafter be forfeited."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="158b"></a>Exact compliance necessary</p>

<p>The affidavit clause is exact and specific. It may be made either by
the printer or the publisher. This exacting and drastic addition to the
manufacturing clause met with strong opposition from the friends of
copyright, particularly authors and book publishers, as unnecessary and
unreasonable, but was successfully insisted upon by the representatives of
the typographical <a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 159]</span>unions. The voiding of copyright because of
a false affidavit by a printer or publisher, which might even be
mistakenly made and of which the author would have no cognizance, was
opposed as especially unjust to authors and out of keeping with the rest
of the law. Under the statute as enacted, this provision must be exactly
complied with, and the courts would doubtless enforce it to the
letter.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="159"></a>Importation questions</p>

<p>The manufacturing provision of 1891 and its extension in the code of
1909 have raised important and difficult questions as to the time at which
these provisions become effective in relation with copyrights previously
existing. It was claimed by Benziger Brothers, as proprietors of a
copyright American edition of the "Key of Heaven," that an edition of
sheets printed in America previous to the law of 1909 and sent abroad for
binding, could be re-imported notwithstanding the new provision against
binding, but the decision of the appraisers at New York against this claim
was upheld by the Secretary of the Treasury, under advice of the
Attorney-General, and the courts have not yet had occasion to pass on the
question. This ruling indicates that since July 1, 1909, copyright could
not be maintained on any book unless type-set, printed and bound
completely within the limits of the United States, and that any
copyrighted books, partly manufactured in the United States, but bound and
otherwise completed abroad since July 1, 1909, must be denied importation.
It has been decided, however, by the Attorney-General, that the
manufacturing requirement as to binding refers only to the original, and
that copyright books rebound abroad cannot be denied importation. Also it
has been held that a foreign translation of a copyright work, for which
translation American copyright is not claimed, cannot be refused
importation. </p>

<p><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
160]</span> The provisions supplementing the manufacturing clause by
prohibiting importation are given in the chapter on importation.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="160"></a>Foreign manufacturing provisions</p>

<p>Holland is the only country in Europe which requires that the deposit
copies shall be printed within the country and thus makes manufacture a
condition of copyright&mdash;an inheritance probably from the times when
the printer-publishers of the Protestant Netherlands were the only ones
printing the books barred in Catholic countries by the <i>index
expurgatorius</i>, and when deposit was naturally required from them. The
law covered the Dutch West Indies, and the precedent was followed in Siam;
and in the Transvaal and Orange State the Dutch law continued after they
had become English colonies. Otherwise than in these countries, only the
British dominions of Canada and Newfoundland and the Commonwealth of
Australia have manufacturing provisions. Canada made such provision as to
domestic copyright in 1886 and again in the act of May 2, 1889, which last
provides that a literary, scientific, musical or artistic work shall,
before or simultaneously with publication or production elsewhere, be
registered in the office of the Minister of Agriculture, and be printed or
published or produced in Canada within one month after publication or
production elsewhere. Newfoundland in its statute of 1892, following our
own of 1891, provided similarly that the condition for obtaining copyright
shall be that the literary, scientific or artistic work shall be printed
and published or produced in this colony. Australia, under the new code of
1905, confines domestic copyright to books (inclusive of drama) "printed
from type set up in Australia, or plates made therefrom, or from plates or
negatives made in Australia in cases where type is not necessarily used,"
and in an artistic work to those "made in Australia." </p>

<p><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
161]</span>Unfortunately, the precedent of our copyright act of 1891 has
since been followed in England in the patent and designs act of 1907,
which provides (sec. 27) that a patent may be revoked after four years "on
the ground that the patented article or process is manufactured or carried
on exclusively or mainly outside the United Kingdom." Such a provision had
been a feature of the patent laws of Germany, Canada and other countries,
but it is new in British law and has evoked strong protest from American
patentees, notwithstanding that it is parallel with our manufacturing
provision with respect to copyrights.</p>

<h4>DRAMATIC AND MUSICAL COPYRIGHT, INCLUDING PLAYRIGHT</h4>

<p class="p2 sidenote"><a name="162a"></a>Dramatists' and composers'
rights</p>

<p>The dramatic author and the musical composer receive recompense for
their creative labor not so much from publication of their works in the
printed form of a book as through their performance or representation,
when protected as playright or performing right, as the artist receives
remuneration not only for the reproduction and sale of copies, but also
from the exhibition as well as sale of his original work. Dramatic and
musical copyright, in the wide sense, therefore, covers copyright in the
specific sense and playright, as to which latter common law rights
especially need statutory protection.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="162b"></a>American provisions</p>

<p>In the protection of dramatic and musical compositions the new American
code specifically provides not only for copyright, but for playright or
right of performance. Under subject-matter of copyright (sec. 5) such
works are classified as "(d) Dramatic or dramatico-musical compositions;
(e) Musical compositions"; and the Copyright Office Rules and Regulations
further define these classes as follows:</p>

<p class="sidenote">Copyright Office definitions</p>

<p>"8. <i>(d) Dramatic and dramatico-musical compositions</i>, such as
dramas, comedies, operas, operettas and similar works.</p>

<p>"The designation 'dramatic composition' does not include the following:
Dances, ballets, or other choregraphic works; tableaux and moving picture
shows; stage settings or mechanical devices by which dramatic effects are
produced, or 'stage business'; animal <a name="Page_163"
id="Page_163"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 163]</span>shows,
sleight-of-hand performances, acrobatic or circus tricks of any kind;
descriptions of moving pictures or of settings for the production of
moving pictures. (These, however, when printed and published, are
registrable as 'books.')</p>

<p>"9. <i>Dramatico-musical compositions</i> include principally operas,
operettas, and musical comedies, or similar productions which are to be
acted as well as sung.</p>

<p>"Ordinary songs, even when intended to be sung from the stage in a
dramatic manner, or separately published songs from operas and operettas,
should be registered as musical compositions, not dramatico-musical
compositions.</p>

<p>"10. <i>(e) Musical compositions</i>, including other vocal and all
instrumental compositions, with or without words.</p>

<p>"But when the text is printed alone it should be registered as a
'book,' not as a 'musical composition.'"</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="163a"></a>Rights assured</p>

<p>To dramatic and musical authors are given (sec. 1) in addition to the
general right, granted in subsection "(a) To print, reprint, publish, copy
and vend the copyrighted work," the specific exclusive rights:</p>

<p>"(b) ... to dramatize it if it be a non-dramatic work; to convert it
into a novel or other non-dramatic work if it be a drama; to arrange or
adapt it if it be a musical work;...</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="163b"></a>Dramatic rights</p>

<p>"(d) To perform or represent the copyrighted work publicly if it be a
drama or, if it be a dramatic work and not reproduced in copies for sale,
to vend any manuscript or any record whatsoever thereof; to make or to
procure the making of any transcription or record thereof by or from
which, in whole or in part, it may in any manner or by any method be
exhibited, performed, represented, produced, or reproduced; and to
exhibit, perform, represent, produce, <a name="Page_164"
id="Page_164"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 164]</span>or reproduce it in
any manner or by any method whatsoever;</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="164a"></a>Musical rights</p>

<p>"(e) To perform the copyrighted work publicly for profit if it be a
musical composition and for the purpose of public performance for profit;
and for the purposes set forth in subsection (a) hereof, to make any
arrangement or setting of it or of the melody of it in any system of
notation or any form of record in which the thought of an author may be
recorded and from which it may be read or reproduced";&mdash;to which
provision of subsection (e), in respect to copyright control of mechanical
records, are added provisos that such control shall not extend to
compositions published and copyrighted before July 1, 1909, and works of
foreigners whose state does not grant similar right to American citizens,
and shall be subject to compulsory license arrangements, requiring that if
the author permits any mechanical reproduction, he shall license any
manufacturer under conditions stated in detail in the act, all of which
exceptions and conditions are fully stated in the chapter on mechanical
music provisions.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="164b"></a>Excepted performance</p>

<p>An exception to these exclusive rights is, however, made in the proviso
(sec. 28) "<i>Provided, however</i>: That nothing in this Act shall be so
construed as to prevent the performance of religious or secular works,
such as oratorios, cantatas, masses, or octavo choruses by public schools,
church choirs, or vocal societies, rented, borrowed, or obtained from some
public library, public school, church choir, school choir, or vocal
society, provided the performance is given for charitable or educational
purposes and not for profit."</p>

<p>This proviso is singularly defective in phraseology, as the phrase
"octavo choruses" has no musical significance and uses a music-trade term
to designate <a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 165]</span>choruses usually but not necessarily
published in octavo form; and the duplication of the words "public
school," etc., is probably a verbal error in the bill which mistakenly
became part of the law. The proviso is doubtless intended and would fairly
be construed to permit gratuitous unauthorized performance of religious or
secular works such as oratorios, cantatas, masses, and choruses by public
schools, church choirs, school choirs or vocal societies, from copies
rented, borrowed, or obtained from some public library, provided the
performance is given for charitable or educational purposes and not for
profit. Curiously the letter of the proviso would seem to provide that the
beneficiary organization cannot perform from a purchased copy, but only
from copies rented, borrowed or "obtained from" some public source; but
this also is an evident error.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="165"></a>Performance "for profit"</p>

<p>It should be noted that the omission from subsection (d) as to drama
and the inclusion in subsection (e) as to music, of the words "for
profit,"&mdash;doubtless with the intent of assuring to the individual
purchaser of music the right to perform it privately,&mdash;have
significance here, and serve, it would seem, to give the dramatic author
absolute control even over gratuitous performances and to limit the
control of the musical author to performances which are not gratuitous, a
negative provision covering, and giving much wider latitude than, the
proviso (sec. 28) above cited. But as dramatico-musical compositions are
classified (sec. 5, d) with dramatic compositions, and an oratorio and
possibly a cantata might be considered as a dramatico-musical composition,
the proviso (sec. 28) may have a specific effect as to this kind of
dramatico-musical compositions. The law is unfortunately defective and
confusing by reason of this proviso and will be so difficult of judicial
construction <a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 166]</span>as to suggest the omission, by amendment,
of this proviso. The use of the word "public" in both cases implies that
the author cannot control private representation and opens other questions
difficult of judicial interpretation.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="166a"></a>Works not reproduced</p>

<p>It is provided (sec. 11): "That copyright may also be had of the works
of an author of which copies are not reproduced for sale, by the deposit,
with claim of copyright, of one complete copy of such work if it be ... a
dramatic or musical composition"; provided that the required deposit of
two copies shall be made, as in the case of books, on publication
thereafter by the multiplication and public sale or distribution of
copies.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="166b"></a>Copyright notice</p>

<p>The notice of copyright must be printed (sec. 18) on each copy, as in
the case of a book in the form "Copyright" or the abbreviation "Copr.,"
"accompanied by the name of the copyright proprietor" and "the year in
which the copyright was secured by publication." In the case of a
published dramatic work the notice must be placed, as in the case of a
book, upon the title-page or the page immediately following, but in the
case of a published musical work the law provides that the notice "shall
be applied ... either upon its title-page or the first page of music," and
this specification makes the copyright notice of doubtful validity if
applied in a musical work on the page following the title-page, unless
this is the first page of music.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="166c"></a>Dramatico-musical works protected
from mechanical reproduction</p>

<p>The classification of dramatico-musical compositions under subsection
(d) as dramatic works and not under subsection (e) as musical
compositions, defines an opera and possibly an oratorio or cantata as a
dramatic rather than a musical composition. As the dramatic author is
given (sec. 1, d) the comprehensive rights over reproduction "in any
manner or by <a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 167]</span>any method whatsoever" while the musical
author is limited (sec. 1, e) in respect to mechanical reproductions, it
would seem to follow that the author of an opera may retain absolute
control over mechanical reproduction, as the author of a non-musical drama
retains absolute control over phonographic or other reproduction of his
drama. This would seem to confine the requirements that the author of a
musical composition permitting mechanical reproduction should license any
manufacturer, to musical compositions which are not dramatic, <i>i.
e.</i>, to instrumental compositions or to songs and other vocal music not
associated with drama. As an overture to an opera is an integral part of
the dramatico-musical composition, it would even seem that an overture
which is part of an opera, or possibly an orchestral introduction or
interlude in an oratorio or cantata, would not be subject to the mandatory
license provided as to musical compositions. But this question has not yet
come before the courts.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="167"></a>Dramatic and musical works excepted
from manufacturing provisions</p>

<p>Dramatic and musical works are not mentioned in the manufacturing and
affidavit provisions (secs. 15, 16, 17) which are specifically confined to
"the printed book or periodical specified in section 5, subsections (a)
and (b)," while dramatic and musical compositions are classified in
subsections (d) and (e). It might be alleged that dramatic or musical
compositions in book form or produced as books from type or by
lithographic or photo-engraving process should be classified as books and
subjected to the manufacturing provisions; but this is distinctly not the
letter of the law. This exception was specifically upheld for music in the
case of Littleton <i>v.</i> Ditson in 1894, by Judge Colt in the
U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court in Massachusetts, where the defense that there
was no copyright in certain songs because the music sheets <a
name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
168]</span>were not from type set or plates made within the United States,
was overruled; and for drama in Hervieu <i>v.</i> Ogilvie in 1909, where
in the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court in New York, Judge Martin cited with
approval Judge Colt's decision. This ruling was also embodied in Treasury
decision No. 21012 of April 17, 1899, permitting the importation of
musical compositions copyrighted in the United States and printed
abroad.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="168a"></a>British colonial practice</p>

<p>The Australian law, on the contrary, specifically includes under the
definition of "book," a "dramatic work" and a "musical work," and thus
subjects both to the manufacturing clause. Printing and publishing are
required in Canada ("within one month after publication or production
elsewhere") and in Newfoundland to obtain copyright under the local acts;
and as drama is not mentioned but included generically as a book or
literary composition, and music is specifically included, both dramatic
and musical compositions must be manufactured within each country to
obtain local, as distinguished from British or Imperial, protection.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="168b"></a>Entry under proper class<br />

<a name="168c"></a>Applications and certificates</p>

<p>The author of a dramatic, dramatico-musical, or musical composition
should therefore be careful to make application in the United States under
class (d) or (e) and not as a book under class (b). The fact that the law
classifies under subsection (d) dramatic or dramatico-musical compositions
and under subsection (e) musical compositions, has caused the Copyright
Office to prepare separate application forms and certificates for
(D<sup><span class="tinier">1</span></sup>) a dramatic composition,
(D<sup><span class="tinier">3</span></sup>) a dramatico-musical
composition and (E<sup><span class="tinier">1</span></sup>) a musical
composition, "published"; as also for (D<sup><span
class="tinier">2</span></sup>) a dramatic composition (or a
dramatico-musical composition) and (E<sup><span
class="tinier">2</span></sup>) a musical composition, "not reproduced for
sale." It would seem advisable therefore that the author of an opera,
oratorio or the like, <a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 169]</span>to obtain the fullest protection under the
law, should enter such work in class (d) as a dramatico-musical
composition rather than in class (e) as a musical composition, and thus
safeguard himself against the mechanical music proviso applied exclusively
to class (e).</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="169a"></a>Right of dramatization</p>

<p>In regard to dramatization, the new American code is specific (sec. 1,
b) in giving to the author of an original work the exclusive right "to
dramatize it if it be a non-dramatic work" or "to convert it into a novel
or other non-dramatic work if it be a drama." The relations of a maker of
a dramatic version of a literary work or of a literary version of a
dramatic work, would follow the same rule as in the case of a translator.
An author has the exclusive right to dramatize or permit the dramatization
of his work, and the dramatization may be copyrighted in the name of the
original author or of the dramatizer, but the dramatizer cannot prevent
another dramatization of the same work unless by transfer of exclusive
right from the original author.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="169b"></a>Dramatization term</p>

<p>The specific copyright on a published dramatization dates from the
publication of the dramatization, which may extend the protection of the
dramatization beyond the copyright term of the original work. But on the
expiration of the copyright in the original work rival dramatizations can
no longer be prevented. All this holds true as to the novelization of a
drama.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="169c"></a>Musical arrangements</p>

<p>In respect to music, the language of the law (sec. 1, e) is thoroughly
comprehensive in covering the arrangement or setting of a musical
composition or of a melody in any notation or in any form whatever. This
gives to the musical author entire control over the use of any part of his
work, as for instance the transcription from an orchestral work for piano
use, the instrumentation of a vocal work or the use for a <a
name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
170]</span>song of any melody in an orchestral work. On the other hand,
variations, transcriptions and so forth of a copyrighted work, made under
authorization from the copyright proprietor, may be separately copyrighted
as to that extent original works.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Copyright Office definitions</p>

<p>The Copyright Office Rules and Regulations say specifically: "(10)
'Adaptations' and 'arrangements' may be registered as 'new works' under
the provisions of section 6. Mere transpositions into different keys are
not expressly provided for in the copyright act; but if published with
copyright notice and copies are deposited with application, registration
will be made."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="170a"></a>Transposition</p>

<p>In Hein <i>v.</i> Harris in 1910, the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court awarded
damages where the chorus of a song proved on transposition into the key of
the copyright song to be practically a copy of the melody.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="170b"></a>Works in the public domain</p>

<p>It is specifically provided (sec. 6) that "adaptations, arrangements,
dramatizations ... or other versions of works in the public domain, ...
shall be regarded as new works subject to copyright," and in the case of
such versions copyright inheres in the dramatizer, adaptor or maker of a
version, as in the case of a translator of a book, in the public domain.
Thus a dramatic or musical work in the public domain may be dramatized or
adapted freely and any individual dramatization or adaptation may be
copyrighted by the dramatizer or adaptor, but he cannot prevent other
dramatization or adaptation of the same work.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="170c"></a>Dramatization right protected by
courts</p>

<p>The American courts have fully upheld the control over dramatization
under the right "to dramatize" specifically given in the law of 1891 and
preserved under the new code. In 1895 in Harper <i>v.</i> Ranous, Judge
Lacombe, in the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court in New York, enjoined a play,
"Trilby," on the ground that the drama "presents characters, plot,
incidents, <a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
171]</span>dramatic situations and dialogue appropriated from Du Maurier's
copyrighted novel," while denying protection against the mere use of the
title. In the same year and in respect to the same novel, in Harper
<i>v.</i> Ganthony, the Harpers, as owners of the copyright of "Trilby,"
also obtained from Judge Lacombe an injunction against Miss Ganthony, who
had presented at the Eden Musée a series of monologues in costume
following the plot of the story, which the judge held to constitute a
dramatic version and therefore an infringement. A story, "The
transmogrification of Dan," purchased by the <i>Smart Set</i> for $85,
copyrighted as part of that periodical and assigned back to the author,
was dramatized by Paul Armstrong and produced by the defendants under the
name of "The heir to the Hoorah," retaining the central incident of the
story, though with modification and extension of the characters, situation
and dialogue. In 1908 Judge Hazel, in Dam <i>v.</i> Kerke La Shelle Co.,
in the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court in New York, awarded the full profits from
the dramatic representation as damages to the executor of Dam, the author
of the story; which decision was fully upheld in 1910 by the Circuit Court
of Appeals through Judge Noyes. Thus the new American code specifically
enacts into statute law previous decisions of the American courts.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="171"></a>English law and practice</p>

<p>Under English law, on the contrary, the right of dramatization has not
been included under copyright; the mere copyrighting of a book could not
prevent its dramatization, but the copyrighting of a work in dramatized
form before its publication as a novel practically prevented other
dramatization of the literary work in so far as the one drama was a
reproduction of the features of the other. As stated by Colles and Hardy
in their recent work (1906) on "Playright and copyright in all countries,"
"a novel is not a <a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 172]</span>dramatic piece, ready and fit for
representation on the stage. Consequently, the author of a novel has the
copyright in his book, but he has no playright according to English law."
The general principles were best stated in 1874 by Chief Justice Cockburn
in Toole <i>v.</i> Young, where Grattan's drama "Glory" was declared not
to be an infringement either of Hollingshead's novel "Not above his
business," on which it was confessedly founded, nor of the dramatic
version made under the title of "Shop" by Hollingshead himself, but never
printed or performed and therefore unpublished: "Two persons may dramatize
the same novel, for that is common property. It is true that a writer
cannot produce and represent a drama, which he has borrowed from a drama
written previously by another person; he would then be representing the
production of the first dramatist.... I wish to guard myself against being
supposed to lay down that, if a writer, while dramatizing a novel, takes
the incidents, characters, and dialogue of a previous drama founded upon
that novel, and reproduces what is in substance identical with the
previous drama, there might not be an infringement of the right of the
earlier dramatist if the later drama be represented on the stage."</p>

<p class="sidenote">The new British code</p>

<p>The new British measure remedies this defect by specifically including
the sole rights to convert a novel or other non-dramatic work, or an
artistic work, into a dramatic work, by way of performance in public or
otherwise, and to convert a dramatic work into a novel or other
non-dramatic work.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="172"></a>Infringement cases</p>

<p>A curious early case was that of Reade <i>v.</i> Conquest in 1862, in
which the son of Charles Reade had made and sold to the defendant, who
produced it at his theatre, a dramatic version of "It is never too late to
mend" in ignorance of the fact that his father had <a name="Page_173"
id="Page_173"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 173]</span>first written a
play called "Gold" and had then transformed that into the novel; in this
the defendant was enjoined because the version which he produced infringed
the earlier play. In Beere <i>v.</i> Ellis in 1889, Baron Pollock enjoined
a rival dramatic version of "As in a looking glass" on the ground that
while bits of dialogue, presumably copied into the defendant's version,
were scarcely substantial, yet a special situation founded on a new
incident not in the novel and certain stage business connected with the
death of the heroine constituted an infringement. In 1890, in Schlesinger
<i>v.</i> Turner, the executors of Wilkie Collins obtained an injunction
against a rival dramatic version of "The new Magdalen," the judge holding
that although the defendant's version had not been copied from the
author's own play, it was substantially similar and therefore an
infringement. That an independent and different dramatic version can,
however, be made, was specifically held in the case of Schlesinger
<i>v.</i> Bedford in the same year, when Collins's executors failed to
obtain an injunction against the defendant's rival dramatic version of
"The woman in white," although the novelist himself had previously
dramatized his work, the judge holding that the two plays were
"essentially different."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="173"></a>Use of substantial quotations</p>

<p>But the use in a play of considerable portions of a copyrighted novel
would be an infringement. That a dramatization using substantial parts of
a novel infringes the novel, was definitely established in 1863 in Tinsley
<i>v.</i> Lacy, where the proprietor of Miss Braddon's "Lady Audley's
secret" and "Aurora Floyd" obtained an injunction against a bookseller who
sold dramatizations under the same titles of which a quarter or more of
the text was taken bodily from the novels. So in 1888 an injunction was
obtained from Judge Stirling, in Warne <i>v.</i> Seebohm, in the Court of
<a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
174]</span>Chancery, against a dramatization of "Little Lord Fauntleroy"
which copied from the novel beyond the limits of fair use and was
therefore considered a "copy" from the work.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="174a"></a>Specific scenes or situations</p>

<p>Where in dramatizing a novel, the dramatic author invents and
introduces new scenes, situations or other features, the copying of such
added features into another dramatic version of the novel, otherwise
independent, constitutes an infringement of the original play. In the case
of Nethersole <i>v.</i> Bell in 1903, with respect to rival English
dramatic versions of Daudet's "Sapho," it was held that while there might
lawfully be independent dramatizations of the novel, the circumstances
indicated that the Espinasse version of the defendant, said to have been
written in Australia, had been so modified consequent to representation of
Clyde Fitch's version, as to constitute an infringement of the plaintiff's
rights. In Tree <i>v.</i> Bowkett in 1896, plaintiff obtained an
injunction against the use by the defendant in a rival dramatic version of
"Trilby" because of two scenes introduced by the plaintiff into his drama
which were not in the novel or in the American dramatization. On the other
hand, in Chatterton <i>v.</i> Cave in 1876, where the plaintiff had
dramatized Eugene Sue's "The wandering Jew" and added two scenes not in
the novel, an injunction was denied by Lord Chief Justice Coleridge
against an independent dramatization, though it had included similar
scenes, on the ground that these were not sufficiently substantial and
material in the play to constitute an infringement. And this application
of the principle of <i>de minimis non curat lex</i> was affirmed by the
House of Lords in 1878.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="174b"></a>What is a dramatic composition<br />

<a name="175a"></a>Judge Blatchford's opinion</p>

<p>As to what is a dramatic composition or representation, no definition
is given in the American law, and the English laws of 1833 and 1842,
quoted beyond, <a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 175]</span>are not explicit. Both English and American
courts have therefore been obliged to make or to extend definitions, but
the decisions have been somewhat confusing. The most explicit general
statement is that made by Judge Blatchford in discussing Daly <i>v.</i>
Palmer in 1868: "A composition, in the sense in which that word is used in
the act of 1856, is a written or literary work invented or set in order. A
dramatic composition is such a work in which the narrative is not related,
but is represented by dialogue and action. When a dramatic composition is
represented in dialogue and action by persons who represent it as real by
performing or going through with the various parts or characters assigned
to them severally, the composition is acted, performed, or represented;
and if the representation is in public, it is a public representation. To
act in the sense of the statute is to represent as real by countenance,
voice, or gesture that which is not real. A character in a play who goes
through with a series of events on the stage without speaking, if such be
his part in the play, is none the less an actor in it than one who, in
addition to motions and gestures, uses his voice. A pantomime is a species
of theatrical entertainment, in which the whole action is represented by
gesticulation without the use of words. A written work consisting wholly
of directions, set in order for conveying the ideas of the author on a
stage or public place by means of characters who represent the narrative
wholly by action, is as much a dramatic composition designed or suited for
public representation as if language or dialogue were used in it to convey
some of the ideas."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="175b"></a>Judicial definitions</p>

<p>In a recent case of Barnes <i>v.</i> Miner in 1903, where an injunction
was asked against a vaudeville change artist who had combined songs in
costume with a cinematograph representation of scenes in the dressing <a
name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
176]</span>room during the changes, Judge Ray, in the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit
Court in New York, declined to grant relief, adding that as a mere
spectacular composition such "sketch" was not properly a dramatic
composition. The English law was construed in 1848 in Russell <i>v</i>.
Smith, when a song "The ship on fire," in which dramatic action was
exhibited by the singer alone without costume or scenery, while seated at
the piano, was construed to be a "dramatic piece"&mdash;the action being
"not related but represented." In 1872, in Clark <i>v.</i> Bishop, a music
hall song "Come to Peckham Rye" was similarly protected as a "dramatic
piece." But in 1895, in Fuller <i>v.</i> Blackpool Winter Gardens Co., it
was held that the song "Daisy Bell," though sung in character costume, was
not a "dramatic piece" because its representation did not require acting
or dramatic effect. Later decision construed the act of 1833 to cover
only spoken words, the English Court of Appeal holding in Scholz <i>v</i>.
Amasis in 1909, through Lord Chief Justice Farwell, that only substantial
copying of written dialogue, and not of a plot or situation, constitutes
infringement, and in Tate <i>v.</i> Fullbrook in 1908, that the writer of
the dialogue is the sole author of the musical sketch though devised and
staged by another. But in two cases, one by Moore in 1903 and one by
Fraser in 1905, against George Edwardes, English juries gave heavy damages
where the scenarios for musical comedies submitted to that theatrical
manager had been made the basis for musical comedies by other writers
afterward produced at Daly's Theatre, London.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="176"></a>Moving pictures may be
infringements</p>

<p>The opinion of Judge Blatchford was quoted and followed by the
U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York, in 1909, in Harper
<i>v.</i> Kalem Co., which said through Judge Ward: "The artist's idea of
describing by action the story the author has written in words is <a
name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 177]</span>a
dramatization. It is not necessary that there should be both speech and
action in dramatic performances although dialogue and action usually
characterize them." In this case the defendants had caused persons to
represent the action in certain scenes of "Ben Hur" and photographed this
representation on a moving picture film, which they reproduced for sale to
theatoriums, where public exhibitions were given for profit. The court
held under the old law that "moving pictures would be a form of expression
infringing the author's exclusive right to dramatize his writings and
publicly to perform such dramatization." The contrary view was held in the
English case of Karno <i>v.</i> Pathé Frères in 1908, where also the Court
of Appeal held, in 1909, that not the manufacturer but the exhibitor of
such a film would be the responsible party if there were infringement.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="177a"></a>Literary merit not requisite</p>

<p>The doctrine that copyright does not depend on literary merit, was
strengthened in a dramatic case in Henderson <i>v.</i> Tompkins in 1894,
in the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court in Massachusetts by Judge Putnam, who held
that a paraphrase of "I wonder if dreams come true," from "Ali Baba,"
constituted an infringement, though the offending piece had slight
literary merit.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="177b"></a>What is a dramatico-musical
composition</p>

<p>As to what is a musical composition, the term defines itself. But the
phrase "dramatico-musical compositions," as used in the American code,
bristles with perplexities, not altogether solved by the definitions of
the Copyright Office Rules, above cited. It means, of course, music and
drama in association, but in this combination the definition of the
dramatic side is peculiarly difficult. Whether a dance, ballet or other
choregraphic work, with or without music, is included, is a mooted
question. In 1892, in Fuller <i>v.</i> Bemis, where the plaintiff sought
to protect a skirt dance of which she had filed a description for
copyright as a <a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 178]</span>dramatic composition, Judge Lacombe, in the
U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court in New York, held that: "It is essential for a
dramatic composition to tell some story. The plot may be simple, it may be
but the representation of a single transaction; but it must repeat or
mimic some action, speech, emotion, passion, or character, real or
imaginary. A series of graceful movements, combined with an attractive
arrangement of drapery, lights, and shadows, telling no story, portraying
no character, depicting no emotion, is not a dramatic composition." This
view is adopted in the Copyright Office Rules and defines accepted
American practice, but is not consonant with English and international
views.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The new British code</p>

<p>The new British measure is definitely comprehensive and specific in
including as a dramatic work "any piece for recitation, choregraphic work
or entertainment in dumb show the scenic arrangement or acting form of
which is fixed in writing or otherwise, and any cinematograph production
where the arrangement or acting form or the combination of incidents
represented give the work an original character."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="178"></a>Protection of playright</p>

<p>It is evident that the methods for securing copyright for published
dramatic and musical works are in general the same, with exceptions noted
in this chapter, as for literary works, that is, publication with
copyright notice and registration with deposit promptly after publication
of two copies of the best edition then published, with a fee of one
dollar. Copyright in the specific sense is, however, of less importance to
the dramatic or musical author, as has already been pointed out, than
playright or performing right, which is also covered and protected
specifically by the code of 1909, though in less accurate, definite and
satisfactory provisions, involving in some respects serious questions. The
right at common law or in equity to prevent the copying, publication or <a
name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 179]</span>use
of an unpublished work and to obtain damages therefor, is specifically
confirmed (sec. 2), and this applies especially to unregistered
manuscripts.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="179"></a>Protection of unpublished work</p>

<p>The method of registration of an unpublished work to secure playright
or performing right, as previously stated, is absolutely simple,
consisting solely in the registration of a claim and the deposit of one
copy of the work in manuscript or other unpublished form, with a fee of
one dollar. The law is clear and satisfactory as to the punishment, after
such registration, of infringement of playright or performing right, but
it is not clear as to the date from which such protection starts, and
whether protection is for an indeterminate period up to publication
(practically in perpetuity if no publication be made), or for the
statutory term. This is because the relations of publication and first
performance are inferences only and specifically defined in the law. The
Copyright Office issues a certificate for twenty-eight years, but without
reference to initial date, which would be presumably the date of the
certificate. The Copyright Office will doubtless, under this precedent,
issue renewal certificate for the second term of twenty-eight years. The
trend, and in several instances the letter of the law, shows publication
to mean the multiplication or reproduction of printed or other copies and
their public offering, sale and distribution, and indicate that
performance, whether privately or publicly and for profit, is not
publication. The new Copyright Office Rules specifically hold that:
"Representation on the stage of a play is not a publication of it, nor is
the public performance of a musical composition publication." Judicial
decisions on this point both in England and this country are confusing if
not contradictory. In the absence of specific provision in the law for
renewal of term in unpublished works, the <a name="Page_180"
id="Page_180"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 180]</span>view that the grant
of the statute is for protection under the common law rather than a
statutory and limited grant of privilege, is defensible and may be upheld
by the courts, should a case arise. No case is likely to arise for
twenty-eight years from the time of first copyright, under the act, of an
unpublished work; but the dilemma will then present itself to the author
whether he should apply for a renewal term and thus accept the limitations
of the statute, or rely upon the original registration as a protection in
perpetuity up to the time of publication. Possibly before that time this
difficult point may be made clear by supplementary legislation.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="180a"></a>Indeterminate protection</p>

<p>The most serious argument against the view that unpublished works may
be protected indeterminately, is founded on the provision of the
Constitution authorizing Congress to grant protection for limited terms,
as to which the view may be upheld that Congress is not here making a
grant, but is offering statutory protection to the inherent right of an
author in an unpublished work.</p>

<p>In any event the author has clear rights for twenty-eight years from
the date of publication or the date of first performance, whichever the
earlier. In case of publication, it is altogether probable that the
playright or performing right will be construed by the courts to lapse at
the end of the copyright term and renewal thereof of the published work,
and in case a "book of the play" or libretto of an opera is printed for
sale within a theatre in connection with the performance, that will
undoubtedly constitute publication and such copies should be
copyrighted.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="180b"></a>Printing and performance</p>

<p>The doctrine that performance is not publication was upheld by the N.
Y. Court of Appeals in Palmer <i>v.</i> DeWitt in 1872, in which the
assignee of the manuscript and playright of Robertson's drama "Play" <a
name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 181]</span>was
granted an injunction against the printing of the drama, although it had
been publicly performed, but not printed, in London. The same doctrine was
applied in the Illinois Supreme Court in 1909 in Frohman <i>v.</i> Ferris.
But publication abroad, by the printing of a drama unless protected under
the international copyright provisions, has been held to forfeit the
common law playright transferred with an unpublished manuscript, by the
decision in Daly <i>v</i>. Walrath in 1899, by Judge Bartlett in the N. Y.
Supreme Court, when an injunction was refused against the performance of
Sudermann's "Die Ehre," translated as "Honor," because the author had
printed the play in Germany despite a contract with the American assignee
to refrain from publication. In the case of Wagner <i>v.</i> Conried in
1903, in the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court in New York, Judge Lacombe declined
to enjoin a production of "Parsifal," holding that the publication of a
printed edition by Schotts in Germany had forfeited playright, since the
reservation by Wagner in his contract with Schotts of the acting rights
was not applicable in this country. The printing of a dramatic manuscript
solely for the use of the players is not publication, as was held in
French <i>v</i>. Kreling, in 1894, by Judge Hawley in the U.&nbsp;S.
Circuit Court in California, where Farnie's opera "Falka," of which the
musical score had been published, but the libretto printed only for the
singers, was protected as an unpublished manuscript.</p>

<p class="sidenote">English confusion<br />

<a name="182"></a>Specific English provisions</p>

<p>The English law as to dramatic and musical copyright and playright and
performing right, has been most confusing if not contradictory, and
authorities differ, as do MacGillivray and Scrutton, in its
interpretation. Whether public performance constitutes publication or
whether they are separable and separate events has been diversely treated
in the laws, by the <a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 182]</span>judges and in legal text-books. The
dramatic copyright act of 1833, known as Bulwer-Lytton's act, a clumsy
attempt to clear up earlier uncertainty, provided that the author of "any
tragedy, comedy, play, opera, farce, or any other dramatic piece or
entertainment, composed, and not printed and published," shall have "the
sole liberty of representing in any part of the British Dominions"; "and
the author of any such production, printed and published," shall, "until
the end of twenty-eight years from ... such first publication" or for
life, have "the sole liberty of representing ... as aforesaid." The
general copyright act of 1842 specifically applied this previous act also
to "musical compositions" and enacted "that the sole liberty of
representing or performing ... any dramatic piece or musical composition"
shall "endure ... for the term in this act provided for ... copyright in
books," that is, for forty-two years or life and seven years; and the
provisions of the act as to copyright and registration were extended to
representing or performing, "save and except that the first public
representation or performance of any dramatic piece or musical composition
shall be deemed equivalent in the construction of this act to the first
publication of any book." The "copyright (musical compositions) act" of
1882 added the requirement, that in the case of a musical composition, to
retain the performing right, notice of reservation should be printed on
the title-page of every published copy, and the act further provided that
the proprietor of the performing right, if the owner of the copyright be
another person, may require him to print such notice of reservation, for
neglect of which he shall forfeit twenty pounds.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Probable effect</p>

<p>Thus common law rights, it would seem, in an unpublished and
unperformed dramatic or musical <a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 183]</span>work were given, pending publication,
statutory protection, apparently in perpetuity, from the date of
composition. Publication of a dramatic or musical composition in printed
form ensured copyright protection as a book for forty-two years or life
and seven years; and performing right was protected for forty-two years
from "the first public representation or performance of any dramatic piece
or musical composition" or life and seven years, whichever the longer.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="183"></a>Publication prior to performance</p>

<p>It had been the view of many English authorities that publication in
printed form as a book before the first public performance forfeited
performing rights, which opinion was shared by the Royal Copyright
Commission as voiced in the report of 1878 in the digest of Sir James
Stephen, who said: "The exclusive right of representing or performing a
dramatic piece or musical composition cannot be gained if such dramatic
piece or musical composition has been printed and published as a book
before the first representation thereof." But in the later case of
Chappell <i>v.</i> Boosey in 1882, in respect to John Oxenford's play of
"The bellringer," which had been printed and published previous to
performance, it was held in the Court of Chancery that publication as a
book before performance does not take away performing rights. On musical
compositions, however, the performing right is forfeited on publication in
print unless notice of reservation is printed on the published copies.
There remain the difficult questions whether when publication precedes
performance the statutory protection of the performing right extends
beyond the forty-two years from publication and whether copyright and
playright should be separately registered. It has been the practice of
English dramatists to give a so-called "copyright performance" at a minor
<a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
184]</span>theatre, in which actors walk and talk through the drama and
the public is invited to pay a shilling at the box office&mdash;and
sometimes given half a crown apiece for the purpose; which performance,
though probably not necessary to fulfill any legal requirement, permits
registration of first performance at Stationers' Hall and gives useful
public notice to possible infringers.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The new British code</p>

<p>This uncertain and confused situation will be remedied under the new
British measure by the inclusion under "copyright" of the right "to
perform ... to deliver, in public" and the making of the copyright term
the "life of the author and fifty years after his death," which together
afford the simplest and most complete protection of playright as incident
to copyright.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="184"></a>British international protection</p>

<p>The international copyright act of 1844 contained the provision "that
neither the author of any book, nor the author or composer of any dramatic
piece or musical composition ... which shall ... be first published out of
her Majesty's dominions, shall have any copyright therein respectively, or
any exclusive right to the public representation or performance thereof,
otherwise than such, if any, as he may become entitled to under this
act,"&mdash;a provision inserted probably for advantage in negotiating
reciprocal conventions with other countries. This provision was applied in
1863, in the case of Boucicault <i>v.</i> Delafield, to a British author
whose play had been first printed and published as well as performed in
America. In Boucicault <i>v.</i> Chatterton in 1876, the Chancery Division
held that the prior performance of "The Shaughraun" in New York was
publication and deprived the author of playright in England,&mdash;which
again seems incompatible with the doctrine upheld in the later case of
Chappell <i>v.</i> Boosey, above cited. Great Britain <a name="Page_185"
id="Page_185"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 185]</span>is the only country
in the International Copyright Union which has declined to accept the
declarative interpretation made in Paris in 1896 of the Berne convention
of 1886, declaring that performance does not constitute publication. Thus
if a dramatic or musical work is first publicly performed outside the
British dominions, the performing right is extinguished therein, unless
protected under the international copyright acts, though first publication
outside the British dominions of a work first publicly performed within
them, may not extinguish the performing right.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Statutory ambiguity</p>

<p>The confusion of judicial interpretations, as to the relations between
performance and publication, in international as well as domestic
copyright, was invited by the unfortunate draftsmanship in the copyright
act of 1842, in which the clause making first performance "equivalent in
the construction of this act to the first publication of any book" may be
taken either in a comprehensive sense or merely as defining the
starting-point for performing right as well as for copyright in the
specific sense.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="185"></a>What is public performance</p>

<p>The question of what is public performance is of some importance,
especially in Great Britain, where playright is not infringed except by
representation in a place of dramatic entertainment and where it has been
held that any place in which a dramatic piece is publicly performed is for
the time a place of dramatic entertainment. A public performance is
probably one to which the public in general is admitted either by sale of
tickets or by invitation; and this would probably include a performance
given before a society to membership in which the public might be
admitted, although a performance limited to a certain class of the public
might not be construed as a public representation. Where "Our boys" was
performed <a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
186]</span>at Guy's Hospital, London, by an amateur company, for nurses
and others connected with the hospital specially invited, it was held in
1884, in Duck <i>v.</i> Bates, that though a performance may be public
where the public are present, although no money is taken, yet the
production in question was not a public representation. In this leading
case, important as a precedent for America as well as in England, the
decision was made by Justices Brett, M. R., and Bowen, L. J., Justice Fry
dissenting, and the Master of the Rolls, in an elaborate opinion,
discussed the relations of private and public performance, as a question
of fact: "In order to entitle the author to penalties there must be a
representation which will injure the author's right to money; such, for
instance, as a representation which, although it is not for profit, would
attract persons who are willing to pay money, and would induce them not to
go and see a performance licensed by the author.... The representation
must be other than domestic or private. There must be present a sufficient
part of the public who would go also to a performance licensed by the
author as a commercial transaction.... I wish to say, by way of warning,
that those who go beyond the facts of the present case may incur the
penalties of the statute."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="186"></a>Manuscript rights</p>

<p>Common law rights in an unpublished manuscript of an unperformed work,
cover both copyright and playright. In 1894, in Gilbert <i>v.</i> Star,
while the comic opera "His Excellency" was in manuscript and under
rehearsal, Justice Chitty in the Court of Chancery granted an injunction
against a newspaper report of the plot and incidents on the common law
ground that its communication to the newspaper involved a breach of
contract, thus confirming the right of an author to full control of his
manuscript work for copyright as well as playright, upheld in Prince
Albert <a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
187]</span><i>v.</i> Strange in 1849. But a dramatic author cannot enjoin
a drama, however similar, completed before the publication or performance
of his own work, as was decided in the case of Reichardt <i>v.</i> Sapte,
in 1893, where the author of "The picture dealer" was denied relief
against the closely parallel play "A lucky dog," which was proved to have
been completed in 1890, though not performed until after the writing and
presentation of the author's play in 1892.</p>

<p class="sidenote">American cases</p>

<p>The right of control of an unpublished dramatic manuscript under common
law was strengthened in Herne <i>v.</i> Liebler, in 1902, by the decision
of Judge Ingraham in the N. Y. Supreme Court, which upheld the right of
the plaintiff to prevent sub-license of a play beyond the terms of the
contract by a licensee, who had agreed to keep the manuscript unpublished
and use it only under specific limitations. In the case of Maxwell
<i>v.</i> Goodwin, in 1899, where the plaintiff's play of "Congress" had
been rejected by the defendant, who afterward produced a play "Ambition,"
also founded on scenes in Washington, Judge Seaman in the U.&nbsp;S.
Circuit Court in Illinois overruled the defendant's contentions that there
was no playright under common law in an unpublished manuscript and that
there was no inherent property right in ideas or creations of the
imagination apart from the manuscript in which they are contained or the
language in which they are clothed; though an injunction was denied on
proof that the defendant had not read the plaintiff's manuscript and that
the actual author of "Ambition" had no knowledge of the plaintiff's
play.</p>

<p>In 1883, in Thomas <i>v.</i> Lennon, where Gounod's "Redemption," of
which the orchestral score was unpublished, had been rewritten for
orchestra from a <a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 188]</span>published non-copyright piano arrangement,
Judge Lowell, in the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court in Massachusetts, ruled
against this as an infringement of the unpublished work on common law
grounds&mdash;but this decision has not been considered good law.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="188a"></a>Dramatic work by employee</p>

<p>Copyright in dramatic work can be obtained, as in the case of
encyclopædic and like works, by the employment for hire of a dramatic
author, as was fully established in the case of Mallory <i>v.</i> Mackaye
in 1898, by Judge Wheeler in the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court in New York,
where Mackaye had contracted for a salary of $5000, that all inventions
and plays by him within the ten years of the contract should belong to
Mallory, and was restricted accordingly from the independent production of
"Hazel Kirke."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="188b"></a>Copyright term</p>

<p>The duration of copyright in dramatic and musical compositions is the
same as for books, in the United States (twenty-eight years with renewal
for twenty-eight years more), in Great Britain (under the new code life
and fifty years), in Australia (forty-two years or life and seven years,
as hitherto in Great Britain), and in Canada and Newfoundland
(twenty-eight years with renewal for fourteen years more),&mdash;as also
in most other countries, the new term for those in the International
Copyright Union which have accepted the convention of Berlin, being life
and fifty years. But in the case of a "dramatico-musical" work, where the
libretto and the music are by different authors, the respective terms may
end at different dates, as was held in 1905, and upheld in 1909, by the
German courts as to the opera "Carmen" under the Franco-German convention
limiting copyright to thirty years after death. Bizet, author of the
music, had died in 1875, but one of the three librettists was still
living, on which facts the court held that the musical score, but not the
libretto, was free from <a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 189]</span>copyright. Under the new British and
Canadian measures, which include the unusual provision that the copyright
term in a work of joint authorship shall be determined by the first
instead of the last death, the result would be to the contrary effect.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="189a"></a>Registration</p>

<p>Registration in the United States, as also in Canada and Newfoundland,
through the deposit of copies, is entirely the same for a dramatic or
musical composition as for a book. Registration in England of a dramatic
or musical composition under the act of 1842 (sec. 20) was to be made at
Stationers' Hall, as in the case of a book, by recording in statutory form
the title, the time and place of first publication, or for performing
right, of first public performance, and the name and abode of author and
of proprietor. But the same law (sec. 24) provided that protection of
performing right in a dramatic piece should not be dependent upon entry in
the registry and, by including in the definition of a dramatic piece (sec.
2) a "musical entertainment," evidently included musical compositions in
this exemption, and thus made registration optional. This view was upheld
in 1848 in Russell <i>v.</i> Smith, when the song "The ship on fire" was
protected as a "dramatic piece," though it had not been registered. The
new British measure omits all requirements for registration of any works.
Registration of any copyright, performing right or assignment is required
in Australia as a prerequisite for legal action.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="189b"></a>Assignment</p>

<p>Assignment or grant of a dramatic or musical composition, as of a book,
may be made (sec. 42) by an instrument in writing, acknowledged, if in a
foreign country, (sec. 43) before a consular or diplomatic officer, and
must be recorded (sec. 44) in the Copyright Office within three months, or
if made in a foreign country, six months, in default of which it is <a
name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
190]</span>void as against any subsequent purchaser. Assignment in Great
Britain must be in writing, and previous to the new code with entry at
Stationers' Hall, in the case of performing right as well as of copyright.
It should be noted that playright does not pass with copyright <i>ipso
facto</i>, though the new code as adopted by the House of Commons has no
specific provision on this point. But it is most desirable that in any
transfer of copyright or playright the exact nature of the right
transferred should be defined in the writing. A partial assignment, or
license, of performing right as well as of copyright may be made, and will
be protected by the courts. The right to grant a specific license, and to
enforce its limitations, was upheld in 1892 in Duck <i>v.</i> Mayen, in an
English court by Justice Day, who held that where the defendant had
obtained license at the price of one guinea to play "Our boys" for charity
at a music hall, but performed it elsewhere, though for the same charity,
the usual royalty of five guineas must be paid. Assignment in Canada and
Newfoundland must be in writing in duplicate copies, of which one must be
deposited in the office of copyright.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="190"></a>Parody</p>

<p>The general principles as to infringement and fair use, treated fully
in another chapter, apply to dramatic and musical compositions, as already
illustrated above, but some special applications may here be noted. That a
parody or burlesque may not be an infringement, though including some
quotations from the work parodied, was decided in 1903, in Bloom <i>v.</i>
Nixon,&mdash;where Fay Templeton had given a parody or imitation of
another actress's singing of "Sammy" in the "Wizard of Oz,"&mdash;in the
U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court in Pennsylvania by Judge McPherson, who held that
as this was essentially an imitation of personality, it was not an
infringement of copyright: "Surely a parody <a name="Page_191"
id="Page_191"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 191]</span>would not infringe
the copyright of the work parodied merely because a few lines of the
original might be textually reproduced." The judge added: "No doubt the
good faith of such mimicry is an essential element; a mere attempt to
evade the owners' copyright ... would properly be prohibited" as "doing in
a roundabout way what could not be done directly."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="191a"></a>Infringement by single
situation</p>

<p>There may be infringement of dramatic copyright in the use of a single
scene or situation, as already set forth with respect to novels, provided
this is of dramatic character. In 1892, in Daly <i>v.</i> Webster, the
U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court of Appeals, through Judge Lacombe, held that the
railroad rescue scene in Brady's "After dark" infringed the copyright of
Daly's "Under the gaslight," which contained the similar situation of the
rescue of a person on a railroad track before an approaching train. Though
there was little dialogue in this scene, the court held that while
mechanical appliances are not entitled to copyright, a series of events
dramatically represented are copyrightable. In the subsequent suit for
damages, Daly <i>v.</i> Brady, the U.&nbsp;S. Supreme Court in 1899,
through Justice Peckham, upheld this decision, and held also that such a
situation constituted an integral part of the copyrighted drama and should
therefore be protected against infringement. That there may be
infringement of a dramatic composition without the use of scenery or
costumes was incidentally decided in Russell <i>v.</i> Smith, where the
song "The ship on fire," sung dramatically without these accessories, was
protected as a dramatic piece.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="191b"></a>Protection of title</p>

<p>While the title of a dramatic or musical composition, like that of a
book, cannot be copyrighted as such, the courts seem disposed to emphasize
the title as an integral part of a play, perhaps more than in the case of
a book because the advertising of another play of <a name="Page_192"
id="Page_192"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 192]</span>like name,
especially in the case of one of long run and wide popularity, may mislead
the public and involve unfair competition. This protection was upheld as a
matter of common law in Aronson <i>v.</i> Fleckenstein in 1886, by Judge
Blodgett in the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court in Illinois, when the use of the
title "Erminie" was held to be unlawful, though the operetta originally
designated by the title had not been copyrighted. But in Glaser <i>v.</i>
St. Elmo Co. in 1909, the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court denied relief where the
title of Miss Evans's novel, then out of copyright, was used for a second
and unauthorized dramatization. There may be danger to copyright or
playright when a work is published or performed under a title differing
from that under which it is copyrighted; but the change of a descriptive
sub-title has been held to be immaterial. In the case of Daly's play
"Under the gaslight," which in the copyright entry bore the sub-title "A
romantic panorama of the streets and homes of New York," but in printed
form the changed sub-title "A totally original picturesque drama of life
and love in these times," the defendants in Daly <i>v.</i> Webster alleged
that this change made the copyright invalid, which contention was
negatived by the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which held in 1892
that the sub-title was merely descriptive and not an essential part of the
title&mdash;a principle later applied by Judge Lacombe in Patterson
<i>v.</i> Ogilvie, in 1902.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="192"></a>Names of characters</p>

<p>In the case of Frohman <i>v.</i> Weber in 1903, in the N. Y. Supreme
Court, where the proprietor of the play entitled "Sherlock Holmes" sought
to enjoin another play "The sign of the four," in which the name Sherlock
Holmes designated the leading character, Judge Clarke held that this did
not constitute unfair competition and denied a preliminary injunction.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="193"></a>Persons liable for infringement<br />

Principal in control</p>

<p>The question of the person liable for the infringement, <a
name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
193]</span>especially of playright, is one of some difficulty. In general,
while any one participating in a piratical performance, as an actor, is
technically guilty of infringement, it is usually the person or persons
responsible for and profiting by the performance who should be sued. The
question of responsibility is one of fact, and the early English decisions
seem confused and even contradictory. The person who has the initiative
and control of a performance, particularly if he is directly the employer
of the performers and has authority to discharge them, may be, <i>par
excellence</i>, the infringer even if he does not know that the
performance is piratical. In 1886, in Monaghan <i>v.</i> Taylor, the
defendant was held liable for infringement because a singer employed in
his music hall sang a copyright song, though the defendant did not choose
or pass upon the number. Thereafter in the "copyright (musical
composition) act" of 1888, it was provided that "the proprietor, tenant or
occupier of any place of dramatic entertainment" shall not be liable,
"unless he shall willfully cause or permit" a performance, "knowing it to
be unauthorized." The courts seem disposed to acquit a mere agent of
responsibility. In 1893, in French <i>v.</i> Day, Gregory, <i>et al.</i>,
it was held by Justice Kennedy as to a performance of "The miner's wife"
asserted to be an infringement of "Lost in London," that the proprietor of
the theatre, Day, "who merely used Gregory," the manager, "as his
mouthpiece," was the responsible defendant. The new British code holds
liable any person who for profit permits a place of entertainment to be
used for an infringing performance unless he were not aware and had no
reasonable grounds for suspecting it to be an infringement.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="194a"></a>Protection against "fly by night"
companies<br />

<a name="194b"></a>State legislation</p>

<p>In the prevention or punishment of unauthorized performances by
irresponsible private companies, the <a name="Page_194"
id="Page_194"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 194]</span>chief obstacle in
the United States was the difficulty of reaching the "fly by night"
companies, as they were called, as they flitted from state to state, and
from one court jurisdiction to another. To remedy this difficulty, an
important protection of the performing right in dramatic works was assured
by the act of January 6, 1897, obtained largely through the efforts of
Bronson Howard, as president of the American Dramatists Club. This act
provided penalty of $100 for the first and $50 for each subsequent
unlawful performance, and imprisonment for not exceeding one year, when
such unlawful performance was willful and for profit; and also that an
injunction issued in any one circuit might be enforced by any other
circuit in the United States. This was in consonance with successful
efforts to obtain the passage of state laws to protect dramatic and
musical works, aside from the federal copyright law, obtained by the
Dramatists Club between 1895 and 1905 in the states of New Hampshire, New
York, Louisiana, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey, Massachusetts,
Minnesota, California, Wisconsin, Connecticut, and Michigan. These varied
in form in the several states, though of the same general purport. The New
York statute, for instance, adds to the penal code a new section as
follows: "Sec. 729. Any person who causes to be publicly performed or
represented for profit any unpublished, undedicated or copyrighted
dramatic composition, or musical composition known as an opera, without
the consent of its owner or proprietor, or who, knowing that such dramatic
or musical composition is unpublished, undedicated or copyrighted and
without the consent of its owner, or proprietor, permits, aids or takes
part in such a performance or representation shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor." The texts in all the states are given in full in Copyright

United States," pages 105-115.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="195a"></a>Remedies under present law</p>

<p>The American code of 1909 enacts (sec. 28) that "any person who
willfully and for profit shall infringe any copyright ... or who shall
knowingly and willfully aid or abet such infringement, shall be deemed
guilty of a misdemeanor," punishable by "imprisonment for not exceeding
one year or by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars nor more than
one thousand dollars, or both, in the discretion of the court"; and
provides (sec. 25, fourth) damages "in the case of dramatic or
dramatico-musical or a choral or orchestral composition, one hundred
dollars for the first and fifty dollars for every subsequent infringing
performance; in the case of other musical compositions, ten dollars for
every infringing performance"; and also provides (sec. 36) for injunction
operative throughout the United States.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="195b"></a>Musical protection in England<br />

<a name="196"></a>Acts of 1902-1906</p>

<p>In England the protection of musical properties under the acts of
1833-42 and 1882-88, had become so difficult that English music publishers
threatened to cease printing new original works because of the freedom
with which they could be pirated. Under the provisions of 1833, as
reënacted in 1842, every infringing performance of a musical composition,
as of a dramatic piece, involved liability to "an amount not less than
forty shillings or the full amount of the benefit or advantage arising
from such representation, or the injury or loss sustained by the plaintiff
therefrom, whichever may be the greater damage," in addition to costs. The
"copyright (musical compositions) act" of 1882 (45 &amp; 46 Victoria, c.
40) had required that the right of public performance should be reserved
by printed notice on each published copy and provided for a penalty of
twenty pounds where the proprietor of the publishing copyright neglected,
after requirement <a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 196]</span>from the owner of the performing right, to
print such notice. The "copyright (musical compositions) act" of 1888 (51
&amp; 52 Victoria, c. 17) provided that the penalty or damages for every
unauthorized performance of any musical composition shall, in the
discretion of the court, be "reasonable" and may be less than forty
shillings for each such performance, or nominal, and that the proprietor,
tenant or occupier should not be liable unless "willfully" causing or
permitting such unauthorized performance, "knowing it to be
unauthorized,"&mdash;but the act specifically excepted "any opera or stage
play" from its provisions. The protest of the musical composers and
publishers led to the passage of the "musical (summary proceedings
copyright) act" of 1902, which authorized a constable to seize without
warrant pirated copies hawked or otherwise offered for sale, on the
written request and at the risk of the copyright owner or by direction of
the court, and provided for their forfeiture and destruction or delivery
to the owner on the decision of the court. A Musical Copyright Committee,
for the consideration of these vexed questions, was appointed by the Home
Office and made a report in 1904; and a further "musical copyright act" of
1906 continued the provisions stated and provided also for the seizure of
plates as well as copies of pirated musical compositions and for the
summary punishment of the offender by fine not exceeding five pounds and,
for a repeated offense, by fine not exceeding ten pounds or imprisonment
not exceeding two months, possession being proof of fraudulent intent
unless the copies bore the name of a printer or publisher. Both these acts
were applicable only within the United Kingdom. These provisions, in
addition to those for injunction and adequate costs, have bettered the
condition of musical properties in England, and <a name="Page_197"
id="Page_197"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 197]</span>they remain
unrepealed, except as to requirement of registration, under the new
British code as adopted by the House of Commons.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="197a"></a>Playright in other countries</p>

<p>In most countries playright in the case of dramatic or musical works is
specifically covered in the copyright statutes or protected in connection
with copyright, although in Austria, Russia, Denmark and Norway, in the
case of music, special notice of reservation is required, while in
Australia special reservation of the performing right must be made on
publication in print of drama or music.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="197b"></a>International provisions</p>

<p>In general, performance is differentiated from publication, and while
in some countries, as above indicated, publication in printed form,
especially of a musical work, may waive the exclusive right of
performance, performance is generally held not to constitute publication.
This view is expressly set forth in the interpretation made at Paris,
1896, of the Berne convention of 1886, whereby section 2 of the
interpretative declaration defines "published works" as "works actually
issued to the public." "Consequently, the representation of a dramatic or
dramatico-musical work, the performance of a musical work ... do not
constitute publication." The Berlin convention of 1908 repeats the same
language in article 4, prefacing it with the definition that "by published
works ('<i>&oelig;uvres publiées</i>') must be understood, according to
the present convention, works which have been issued ('<i>&oelig;uvres
éditées</i>')"&mdash;the English text here given being the official
translation of the U.&nbsp;S. Copyright Office.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="197c"></a>Foreign protection of
arrangements</p>

<p>In most foreign countries which include musical compositions under
subjects of copyright either as covered under "literary and artistic
works" or by specific mention, the general principles as to arrangements
and adaptations hold in such countries. Several <a name="Page_198"
id="Page_198"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 198]</span>countries, as
Belgium, specify however "the exclusive right of making arrangements on
motives of the original composition," Brazil, Luxemburg, Mexico, Nicaragua
and Tunis following this precedent in nearly identical language. Germany
specifically protects the "sole right of making extracts from musical
works and arranging for orchestra or in parts." Spain specifies among its
prohibitions "the total or partial publication of melodies, with or
without accompaniment, transposed or arranged for other instruments or
with different words." Hungary specifies that "every arrangement of a
musical work, published without the consent of the author, which cannot be
considered as a composition in itself," is an infringement. Where,
however, the author of a work permits or licenses an adaptation or
arrangement, or an original adaptation or arrangement is made from a work
in the public domain, that is properly a separate subject of copyright, as
is specified in the statutes of Colombia, to the effect that "variations,
etc., on a theme or air which is public property, constitutes property.
Transpositions are similar to translations of literary subjects."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="198"></a>International definitions</p>

<p>Dramatic and musical works were specifically included under the
protection of the International Copyright Convention of Berne, 1886, by
the definition in article IV of "literary and artistic works" as including
"dramatic or dramatico-musical works; musical compositions with or without
words." In the Berlin convention, 1908, the same general term was defined
in article 2 as including "dramatic or dramatico-musical works;
choregraphic works and pantomimes, the stage directions ('<i>mise en
scène</i>') of which are fixed in writing or otherwise; musical
compositions with or without words." "Adaptations, arrangements of music,
etc., are specially included," <a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 199]</span>in the phraseology of article X of the
convention of 1886, "amongst the illicit reproductions to which the
present convention applies, when they are only the reproduction of a
particular work, in the same form, or in another form, with non-essential
alterations, or abridgments, so made as not to confer the character of a
new original work"; and practically the same language is repeated in
article 12 of the convention of 1908. On the other hand, "adaptations,
arrangements of music," etc., are protected as original works without
prejudice to the rights of the author of the original work, in article 2
of the convention of 1908.</p>

<p>The German law of 1901 permits, however, extract from or other use of
musical compositions in adaptations or arrangement under specified
circumstances, as for family, social or other gratuitous performance,
under the limitations of the law, which exception seems to be permitted
also under the law of 1910.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="199"></a>National formalities</p>

<p>Throughout the countries of the International Copyright Union, first
publication in any of these countries and compliance with its formalities
entitle the author to playright as well as copyright in all the other
countries within the Union, with some exceptions to be noted. Thus in
Switzerland the conditions of performance must be given at the head of the
printed play; and the law stipulates that the author may not require as
royalty more than two per cent of the gross profits, and a performance at
which the admission fee is reckoned to cover only cost of production or a
performance for charitable purposes, is not considered an infringement of
playright. In Italy a play performed, but not printed and published, must
be submitted in manuscript for inspection within three months of first
performance, together with a declaration reserving the playright; a
printed book or play should be deposited with accompanying <a
name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
200]</span>notice of reservation within three months, or the proprietor
cannot obtain damages until such deposit, and failure to deposit within
ten years abandons copyright protection. Italian proprietors of music
sometimes refrain from printing and publishing music, with the intent of
maintaining copyright and playright indefinitely.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="200"></a>Specific reservations or
conditions</p>

<p>In Luxemburg and Sweden, reservation of playright must be stated on
printed copies, as is also the case as to music in these countries and in
the other countries elsewhere cited. In Sweden, the term for playright is
less than for copyright in the printed work, being for life and thirty
years only. In Sweden and Norway, the author protecting his rights by
first publication in these countries, must be a citizen of one of the
countries within the International Copyright Union or must acquire rights
through a publisher therein; though in the other countries of the Union,
this question of nationality is immaterial. In Norway and Denmark, there
must be reservation of right of recitation, but in Norway this lapses in
any event at the end of three years, provided the recitation does not take
the shape of a dramatic performance. In Holland and the Dutch Indies,
reservation of playright must be given, and printing within the country
has hitherto been required to protect a published work. In Hungary, the
author of a play must give his name on the title-page or in the
announcement of the play, and protection is extended to foreigners who
have been for two years rate-payers and residents in Hungary, as well as
those whose countries have reciprocal relations. In Finland, the author's
name and reservation of playright must be given on the printed copy, and
protection is extended to foreigners on condition of residence and
publication in Finland.</p>

<p><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
201]</span> Most of the smaller European countries and many South American
countries, including playright under copyright, base protection on
reciprocal protection of their citizens in other countries, while
protection of performing rights in Brazil requires notice on printed plays
of the reservation of royalty for performance. In many oriental countries,
as Egypt, China, etc., protection is afforded to some extent in the
consular courts.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="201"></a>Pan American Union</p>

<p>In the Pan American Union, the Buenos Aires convention of 1910
specifically includes dramatic and musical works as literary works,
without special provisions.</p>

<h4>MECHANICAL MUSIC PROVISIONS</h4>

<p class="p2 sidenote"><a name="202a"></a>"Canned music" contest</p>

<p>As the international copyright provision with the manufacturing clause
was the central feature of the copyright campaign culminating in the law
of 1891, so the provision for the control of mechanical music with the
compulsory license clause was the central feature of the contest
culminating in the act of 1909. This came to be known as the "canned
music" fight, and arguments pro and con consumed the greater part of the
hearings before the Committees on Patents. The solution finally reached
was in the provisos added to the musical subsection (e) of section 1 of
the bill, which in full is as follows:</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="202b"></a>Mechanical music provisos<br />

<a name="203a"></a>Compulsory license</p>

<p>"(e) To perform the copyrighted work publicly for profit if it be a
musical composition and for the purpose of public performance for profit;
and for the purposes set forth in subsection (a) hereof, to make any
arrangement or setting of it or of the melody of it in any system of
notation or any form of record in which the thought of an author may be
recorded and from which it may be read or reproduced: <i>Provided</i>,
That the provisions of this Act, so far as they secure copyright
controlling the parts of instruments serving to reproduce mechanically the
musical work, shall include only compositions published and copyrighted
after this Act goes into effect, and shall not include the works of a
foreign author or composer unless the foreign state or nation of which
such author or composer is a citizen or subject grants, either by treaty,
convention, agreement, or law, to citizens of the United States similar
rights: <i>And</i> <a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 203]</span><i>provided further, and as a condition of
extending the copyright control to such mechanical reproductions</i>, That
whenever the owner of a musical copyright has used or permitted or
knowingly acquiesced in the use of the copyrighted work upon the parts of
instruments serving to reproduce mechanically the musical work, any other
person may make similar use of the copyrighted work upon the payment to
the copyright proprietor of a royalty of two cents on each such part
manufactured, to be paid by the manufacturer thereof; and the copyright
proprietor may require, and if so the manufacturer shall furnish, a report
under oath on the twentieth day of each month on the number of parts of
instruments manufactured during the previous month serving to reproduce
mechanically said musical work, and royalties shall be due on the parts
manufactured during any month upon the twentieth of the next succeeding
month. The payment of the royalty provided for by this section shall free
the articles or devices for which such royalty has been paid from further
contribution to the copyright except in case of public performance for
profit: <i>And provided further</i>, That it shall be the duty of the
copyright owner, if he uses the musical composition himself for the
manufacture of parts of instruments serving to reproduce mechanically the
musical work, or licenses others to do so, to file notice thereof,
accompanied by a recording fee, in the copyright office, and any failure
to file such notice shall be a complete defense to any suit, action, or
proceeding for any infringement of such copyright.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="203b"></a>Damages</p>

<p>"In case of the failure of such manufacturer to pay to the copyright
proprietor within thirty days after demand in writing the full sum of
royalties due at said rate at the date of such demand the court may award
taxable costs to the plaintiff and a reasonable <a name="Page_204"
id="Page_204"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 204]</span>counsel fee, and
the court may, in its discretion, enter judgment therein for any sum in
addition over the amount found to be due as royalty in accordance with the
terms of this Act, not exceeding three times such amount.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="204a"></a>Public performance</p>

<p>"The reproduction or rendition of a musical composition by or upon
coin-operated machines shall not be deemed a public performance for profit
unless a fee is charged for admission to the place where such reproduction
or rendition occurs."</p>

<p>This provision, though somewhat involved in form, tells its own story,
and there has thus far been no occasion for judicial construction.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="204b"></a>The compromise result</p>

<p>In the series of discussions before the Committees, the friends of
copyright argued for the exclusive and unrestricted right of the musical
composer to control absolutely the mechanical reproductions of his work,
while the representatives of "canned music" argued at first that
mechanical reproduction should be permitted without reference to
copyright, and later that there should be entire liberty to make
reproductions of a musical work on the sole condition of a specified
payment to the copyright proprietor. The provision as actually adopted was
a compromise upholding the negative right of the author to prevent
mechanical reproduction, but requiring him, in the event of a grant of
authority to any one manufacturer to reproduce his work mechanically, to
extend that privilege to any other manufacturer on payment of the
specified royalty. This scheme is practically modeled on what was known as
the Pearsall-Smith royalty plan, which, as proposed for books, was stoutly
fought by the proponents of the copyright act of 1891, throughout that
memorable copyright campaign.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="205"></a>Judicial construction</p>

<p>In the case of the White-Smith Music Pub. Co. <i>v.</i> Apollo Co., in
which the Æolian Co. was supposed <a name="Page_205"
id="Page_205"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 205]</span>to be the real
complainant, the representatives of the musical author were, in 1906,
denied protection against the mechanical music rolls made by the
defendant, by the Circuit Court of Appeals, where the judges considered
themselves "constrained" by the necessity of strict construction to decide
that "a perforated roll is not a copy in fact of complainant's staff
notation," while saying "that the rights sought to be protected belong to
the same class as those covered by the specific provisions of the
copyright statutes." It was presumed by many during the copyright campaign
that the Supreme Court would make a broad construction of the statute, but
that court held, February 24, 1908, in an opinion written by Justice Day,
that the considerations adduced "properly address themselves to the
legislative and not to the judicial branch of the Government" and that "as
the act of Congress now stands, we believe it does not include these
records as copies or publications of the copyright music involved in these
cases." Justice Holmes, while not dissenting, added a memorandum to the
effect that "the result is to give to copyright less scope than its
rational significance and the ground on which it is granted seems to me to
demand.... On principle, anything that mechanically reproduces that
collocation of sounds ought to be held a copy, or if the statute is too
narrow, ought to be made so by a further act, except so far as some
extraneous consideration of policy may oppose." While the judges thus felt
"constrained" to deny relief, their strong language in defense of
copyright control doubtless had its effect upon the legislative
authorities in the framing and the passage of the new code.</p>

<p>This decision was confirmatory of an earlier decision, in Stern
<i>v.</i> Rosey in 1901, of Judge Shepard in the Court of Appeals in the
District of Columbia, <a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 206]</span>that the mechanical reproduction of two
copyrighted songs could not be prevented under the existing law.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="206a"></a>Punishment of infringement</p>

<p>Specific and elaborate provision is made for the punishment of
infringers under the mechanical music proviso (sec. 1, e) by sec. 25,
e:</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="206b"></a>Notice to proprietor of intention
to use</p>

<p>"Whenever the owner of a musical copyright has used or permitted the
use of the copyrighted work upon the parts of musical instruments serving
to reproduce mechanically the musical work, then in case of infringement
of such copyright by the unauthorized manufacture, use, or sale of
interchangeable parts, such as disks, rolls, bands, or cylinders for use
in mechanical music-producing machines adapted to reproduce the
copyrighted music, no criminal action shall be brought, but in a civil
action an injunction may be granted upon such terms as the court may
impose, and the plaintiff shall be entitled to recover in lieu of profits
and damages a royalty as provided in section one, subsection (e), of this
Act: <i>Provided also</i>, That whenever any person, in the absence of a
license agreement, intends to use a copyrighted musical composition upon
the parts of instruments serving to reproduce mechanically the musical
work, relying upon the compulsory license provision of this Act, he shall
serve notice of such intention, by registered mail, upon the copyright
proprietor at his last address disclosed by the records of the copyright
office, sending to the copyright office a duplicate of such notice; and in
case of his failure so to do the court may, in its discretion, in addition
to sums hereinabove mentioned, award the complainant a further sum, not to
exceed three times the amount provided by section one, subsection (e), by
way of damages, and not as a penalty, and also a temporary injunction
until the full award is paid." </p>

<p class="sidenote">Copyright Office form and fees</p>

<p><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
207]</span>The Copyright Office provides a special form (U) on a blue card
for registration of "notice of use on mechanical instruments," in which
the copyright owner of a musical composition gives notice that he "has
used or has licensed the use of said composition for the manufacture of
parts of instruments serving to reproduce mechanically such musical work."
The recording fee for such notice, as fixed by the statute (sec. 61), is
twenty-five cents for the first fifty words and twenty-five cents
additional for each additional hundred words.</p>

<p>For recording and certifying the license referred to (sec. 1, e) the
statute provides (sec. 61) for a fee of one dollar for not over three
hundred words, two dollars if not over one thousand words and one dollar
for each additional one thousand words or fraction thereof over three
hundred words.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="207"></a>The constitutional question</p>

<p>The actual fixing of a specified price, as that of two cents or a
halfpenny on each reproduction, is a feature quite new in law, American or
English, and involves a serious constitutional question. Congress has
granted to the Interstate Commerce Commission, and state legislatures to
specified authorities, as public service commissions, power to regulate
prices; and the U.&nbsp;S. Supreme Court, in 1909, confirming the N. Y.
Court of Appeals in the Consolidated Gas Co. cases, upheld the application
of the sovereign power of the state to limit the price of gas to 80 cents
per 1000 cubic feet, as sold by a corporation enjoying a public franchise.
In this compulsory license provision of the copyright code, Congress has
gone further in two directions: it has fixed a royalty price, not by
definition or limitation of a "reasonable" price, but absolutely, and it
has applied this provision not to a corporation enjoying franchise
privileges, but to the individual owner of property created by his own
labor. </p>

<p class="sidenote"> <a name="208"></a>English law</p>

<p><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
208]</span>The English laws had not mentioned mechanical reproduction up
to the musical copyright act of 1906, which in section 3 expressly
provided that "'pirated copies' and 'plates' shall not, for the purposes
of this Act, be deemed to include perforated music rolls used for playing
mechanical instruments, or records used for the reproduction of sound
waves, or the matrices or other appliances by which such rolls or records
respectively are made." The test case meanwhile on this question was that
of Boosey v. Whight, which was finally decided in the Court of Appeal in
1900, with respect to the use of copyrighted songs on the perforated rolls
of the Æolian. Justice Sterling in the lower court had decided that the
perforations were not an infringement of the copyright but that the
marginal directions for playing might be such; Justice Lindley, M. R.,
held with him that the perforated roll was not a "copy" of the sheet
music, but overruled him on the second point, holding that the directions,
though copied from the printed page, were neither music nor a literary
composition.</p>

<p class="sidenote">The new British code</p>

<p>The new British measure as prepared in 1910 included as incident to
copyright the sole right "in the case of a literary, dramatic or musical
work, to make any record, perforated roll, cinematograph film, or other
contrivance by means of which the work may be mechanically performed or
delivered," thus in the simplest fashion completely covering the control
of mechanical reproduction in conformity with the convention of Berlin.
But in the Parliament of 1911 the bill emerged from committee stage with
an elaborate proviso, based on the American precedent, excepting from the
definition of infringement contrivances for the mechanical reproduction of
sounds on (1) proof that the copyright owner has previously acquiesced in
mechanical reproduction, (2) prescribed notice of <a name="Page_209"
id="Page_209"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 209]</span>intention, and (3)
payment of royalty of 2-1/2 or 5 per cent with a minimum of a halfpenny
for each record, or in the case of different works on the same record, to
each copyright proprietor.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="209a"></a>The Berne situation, 1886</p>

<p>When the international representatives met at Berne in 1886, the
mechanical reproduction of music was confined chiefly if not wholly to
Swiss music-boxes and orchestrions and to hand-organs, of comparatively
little commercial importance; and, possibly with some thought of the
recognition of the hospitality of Switzerland, little emphasis was placed
on the protection of musical composers against mechanical reproduction of
their works. In fact, the final protocol of the Berne Convention of 1886
contained, as clause 3, the following paragraph: "It is understood that
the manufacture and sale of instruments for the mechanical reproduction of
musical airs which are copyright, shall not be considered as constituting
an infringement of musical copyright."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="209b"></a>Lack of action at Paris, 1896</p>

<p>Despite strong representations at the congresses of the International
Association for the protection of literary property, held at London in
1890, Neufchâtel in 1891, and Milan in 1892, and a vigorous endeavor in
connection with the Paris convention of 1896 to replace this clause, it
was not modified until the convention of Berlin in 1908, in preparation
for which a strong resolution was passed at the congress of the
International Association at Vevey in 1901.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="209c"></a>The Berlin provision, 1908</p>

<p>With the increasing development of the phonograph and of the mechanical
player, mechanical reproductions became so important a matter to musical
composers and publishers, that much of the discussion in respect to the
amendatory convention of Berlin of 1908 was upon this subject. In the
amended convention, the subject was fully covered by article 13:</p>

<p>"Authors of musical works have the exclusive right <a name="Page_210"
id="Page_210"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 210]</span>to authorize: (1)
the adaptation of these works to instruments serving to reproduce them
mechanically; (2) the public performance of the same works by means of
these instruments.</p>

<p>"The limitations and conditions relative to the application of this
article shall be determined by the domestic legislation of each country in
its own case; but all limitations and conditions of this nature shall have
an effect strictly limited to the country which shall have adopted
them.</p>

<p>"The provisions of paragraph 1 have no retroactive effect, and
therefore are not applicable in a country of the Union to works which, in
that country, shall have been lawfully adapted to mechanical instruments
before the going into force of the present Convention.</p>

<p>"The adaptations made by virtue of paragraphs 2 and 3 of this article
and imported without the authorization of the parties interested into a
country where they are not lawful, may be seized there."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="210"></a>German precedents</p>

<p>In Germany, under the general copyright law of 1870, the higher courts
gave to musical composers control over mechanical reproductions from
which, as the industry grew, the authors or publishers obtained some
little return. But succeeding the adoption of the permissive clause in the
Berne convention of 1886, it was proposed in the new copyright law to free
mechanical reproductions from the control of the composer. A protest was
at once made by musical authors and publishers, which resulted in a
modification of the form proposed by the government and the addition of a
clause giving control where the reproduction involved personal
interpretation. In this form the "unfortunate section 22" became part of
the law of 1901 relating to copyright in literary and musical works.
Section 22 was in the following language: </p>

<p><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 211]</span>
"Reproduction is permitted when a musical composition is, after
publication, transferred to such discs, plates, cylinders, bands and
similar parts of instruments for the mechanical rendering of pieces of
music. This provision is applicable also to interchangeable parts,
provided that they are not applied to instruments by which the work can,
as regards strength and duration of tone and tempo, be rendered in a
manner resembling a personal performance."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="211"></a>Law of 1910</p>

<p>This had the extraordinary and contradictory effect of giving the
author control over the finer reproductions of his works but denying to
him any control over the cruder reproductions, as on hand-organs,
orchestrions, etc. The opposition which developed against this impossible
situation was largely influential in bringing about the modification at
Berlin in 1908 of the Berne clause. The law of May 22, 1910, amended the
previous general laws in conformity with the Berlin convention, especially
by extending protection to the mechanical reproduction of music and
cinematograph reproduction of artistic works. Section 22 of the law of
1901 was specifically replaced by an elaborate section, modeled on the
American compulsory license provision and requiring a composer who
permitted mechanical reproduction to grant similar rights on equal terms
to any other manufacturers domiciled in Germany, with provisions for
reciprocity and for the treatment of non-German composers through the
tribunals of Leipzig. This law became effective coördinately with the
Berlin convention on September 9, 1910, and in connection with it an
ordinance promulgated by the Emperor July 12, 1910, defined the time
during which mechanical reproductions already made of copyrighted works
should still be permitted. The use of extracts from musical as from other
works, as perhaps in <i>potpourris</i>, <a name="Page_212"
id="Page_212"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 212]</span>seems however still
to be permitted as a result of the law of 1901.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="212a"></a>Germany and the United States</p>

<p>As a result of the reciprocal provisions of the new German law, the
President of the United States on December 8, 1910, proclaimed reciprocal
relations between Germany and the United States with reference to
mechanical reproductions of music. In the opinion of May 6, 1911, approved
by the Attorney-General, a Presidential proclamation is required to
determine "the existence of reciprocal conditions" as to the mechanical
music provision (sec. 1, e) as in respect to sec. 8; but as the
proclamation of December 8 did not recite that reciprocal conditions
existed between September 9 and December 8, 1910, it is held that "it
would not afford evidence sufficient to sustain an action for infringement
between said dates."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="212b"></a>French precedents</p>

<p>In France the general copyright act of 1793, as considered to cover
mechanical music, was interpreted or modified by the act of 1866, which
enacted that "the manufacture and sale of instruments serving to reproduce
mechanically musical airs which are still in the private domain, does not
constitute musical infringement." In the suit of Enoch <i>v. Société des
phonographes et gramophones</i>, the Civil Court of the Seine had decided
in 1903 that phonographic instruments were excepted from the protection of
the law of 1793 by the "general immunities" concerning the mechanical
musical instruments in the act of 1866. But in 1905 the Court of Appeals
of Paris reversed this decision, holding that the law of 1866 applied
solely to musical airs, that is, those involving no words, on the ground
that the law of 1793 was enunciatory of the rights of authors, applying to
all modes of publication and distribution, and that the word "publication"
should be understood broadly "as jurisprudence has applied it to numerous
modes of publication discovered <a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 213]</span>since the law of July 19 and 24, 1793, and
the Code of 1810, and as nothing prevents its extension, in consequence of
scientific progress"; and it therefore concluded that literary works
either by themselves or associated with music were practically under the
law of 1793 and not exempted by the law of 1866. A more recent case, in
the Court of Commerce of the Seine in 1905, resulted, however, in the
dismissal of a suit for infringement. France accepted the Berlin
convention, June 28, 1910; but its provision in article 13, that "the
limitations and conditions" as to mechanical music protection "shall be
determined by the domestic legislation of each country in its own case,"
makes uncertain whether protection becomes effective in the absence of
specific legislation.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="213a"></a>Belgian precedents</p>

<p>In Belgium in 1904, in the suit of Massenet and Puccini <i>v. Compagnie
Générale des phonographes, et al.</i>, it was held by the court of first
instance of Brussels that the introduction for sale of discs and cylinders
reproducing the musical compositions of the plaintiffs was illegal and
liable for damages and punishable as an infringement. This decision was,
however, overruled by the Court of Appeals of Brussels in 1905. Belgium
accepted the Berlin convention, May 23, 1910, has since protected
mechanical reproduction, and was proclaimed as in reciprocal relations
with the United States, June 14, 1911.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="213b"></a>Italian precedents</p>

<p>In Italy the copyright law was considered in relation to mechanical
instruments by several court decisions of which the latest and most
important seems to be in the case of the <i>Società Italiana d. Autori
v.</i> Gramophone Co. of London, in which, in 1906, the Royal Court of
Milan held that reproductions of music by gramophone constituted
infringement. This decision held that article three of the Berne
convention of 1886 could not derogate from or modify the domestic <a
name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
214]</span>private law of 1882, and as the Italian law specifically covers
publication and reproduction "by any method," it includes gramophone
discs. "Publication means a process by which the intellectual concept of
the artist is revealed, and brought to the knowledge of others." "What the
legislature wanted has been this: that the author be the exclusive owner
of the external form in which the creation of the mind has been fixed,
and, so to speak, materialized; and that the right be reserved to him to
get from his studies and his exertions all the economic benefits which he
could derive therefrom."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="214a"></a>Other countries</p>

<p>In the laws of Switzerland of 1883, and Monaco and Tunis of 1889, the
fabrication and sale of mechanical instruments or devices for reproducing
musical airs were excepted from the definition of piracy. But all these
countries have ratified the Berlin convention "without reservation."
Luxemburg and Norway have applied the Berlin provision and were proclaimed
as in reciprocal relation with the United States on June 14, 1911. Russia
has followed American precedent in the new law of 1911, but has no
reciprocal relations with the United States.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="214b"></a>Argument for inclusion</p>

<p>As the opposition to the control by musical composers of mechanical
reproductions of their works is still strong in the United States and in
several countries, notwithstanding recent conventions and legislation, and
is based largely upon restrictive definitions of the words "writings" and
"copies" or their equivalent in other languages, it may be well to include
here the argument made by the writer as Vice-president of the American
(Authors) Copyright League, at the Congressional hearings on the new
American code, of which the essential portions are as follows:</p>

<p>"The American Copyright League stands, as it has stood for a quarter of
a century, simply and <a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 215]</span>solely for the protection of authors'
rights to the fullest extent, and it asserts that a musical composer is as
fully entitled as is the author of any other creative work to the
exclusive and full benefits of his compositions, in whatever manner
reproduced. The opponents of the bill base their objections largely on a
restrictive definition of the word 'writings,' and criticise the bill
because this word 'writings' is interpreted throughout the bill by the
word 'works,' although this accurately reflects the understanding of
Congress and the interpretation of the courts. They would, in fact,
confine copyright protection specifically, it may be said, to e-y-e-deas,
that is, visible records, and exclude as not visible or legible by the
eye, copies of musical compositions mechanically made and interpreted.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="215"></a>Inscribed writings<br />

<a name="216a"></a>Direct sound-writing</p>

<p>"The earliest <i>writing</i> which remains to us is in the Assyrian
wedge-shaped inscriptions, made by pressing the end of a squared stick
into a soft clay cylinder; the phonograph point inscribes its record in
exactly the same manner upon the 'wax' or composition of the cylinder or
disc, for the mechanism only revolves the roll, and the point is actuated
by the sound vibrations. The words 'phonograph,' 'graphophone' and
'gramophone' literally mean 'sound-writing,' for the Greek form
<i>graph-</i>, the Latin form <i>scrib-</i>, and the Saxon form
<i>write</i>, equally parts of our language, denote exactly the same
meaning. It is even probable that a future development of phonograph
impressions (the third dimension being translated into breadth of stroke
as can be mechanically done) will give ultimately a visual phonograph
alphabet even more natural and logical than Professor Bell's remarkable
system of 'visible speech,' which, of course, like all alphabets, can be
read only when the reader has mastered the significance of the <a
name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
216]</span>symbols. Mr. Edison has himself made some experiments in this
direction, though the confusion from the overtones, which give
<i>quality</i> of speech, has so far prevented result. A large share of
literary productivity to-day is by voice-dictation recorded mechanically
by a stenographer on the typewriter or directly on the phonograph disc,
and I may instance from personal experience a further step. As one of the
committee for the Edison birthday dinner, commemorating the twenty-fifth
anniversary of his invention of the incandescent lamp, I was asked to
supply some original verse, and it occurred to me to put this in shape by
help of Mr. Edison's inventions, without direct or indirect hand- or
typewriting. Accordingly I completed the verses mentally without use of
paper and voiced them into an Edison phonograph, verifying this through
the telephone, and the lines were set in type by the printer from the
sound-record, and thus printed on the <i>menu</i> for the dinner. Thus my
formulated ideas were recorded through the nerves and other mechanism of
the vocal organs, instead of through the nerves and other mechanism of the
hand, directly by the phonograph point on the phonograph cylinder; and it
seems a common-sense inference that if I had caused copies of the
phonograph cylinder, though not legible in the ordinary sense, to be
published instead of the secondary copies in print, I should be as much
entitled to copyright protection in the one case as in the other. The
'telegraphone' directly records on a steel tape the sounds of the human
voice as sent through the telephone, and by an absolutely invisible
re-arrangement of the magnetized particles of steel, makes a writing in
which there is no possibility of visual legibility.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="216b"></a>Music transmissal</p>

<p>"Moreover, invention is now developing a series of reproducing
mechanisms such as Dr. Cahill's 'telharmonicon' <a name="Page_217"
id="Page_217"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 217]</span>or 'dynamophone,'
in which musical compositions will be translated to the ear without the
interposition even of a cylinder or disc sound-record; and it seems a
common-sense inference that the musical composer should have as full
rights in this as in other forms of copying or reproducing his thought.
Buda-Pesth is said to have not only a telephone 'newspaper,' but a system
of reading novels and other works of literature to telephone subscribers,
and if this should reach such proportions as substantially to reduce the
sale of the printed copies of a new novel from which the author would
receive benefit, it would also seem a common-sense inference that the same
or an equivalent royalty should be paid him.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="217"></a>Music notation</p>

<p>"In music writing or notation there are two and only two essentials:
relative vertical position, showing pitch, and relative horizontal
position, showing duration of notes. The earliest form of our present
music writing is the system of the 'large,' 'long,' 'breve' and
'semi-breve' notes, in which the pitch was shown by the vertical relations
of the notes, and the length of the note by the length of the black mark,
the 'large' mark being twice the length of the 'long' mark. This
corresponds closely to the perforated music roll of to-day, which could be
read by a practiced eye with and probably without staff lines, to the
extent that if every other form of reproduction were destroyed, the melody
and harmony of a musical work could be reproduced into the ordinary
notation of music writing. I speak from personal knowledge of these music
rolls, having had a mechanical instrument for some years. The different
kinds of rolls differ in the relative spacing and in distance from the
edge of the roll, which gives the standard, but a foreshortened photograph
of any, bringing them to the same scale, would pattern closely the <a
name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
218]</span>early form of music writing above cited. The London postal
telegraph system dispatches newspaper material from St. Martin's le Grand
throughout the kingdom from continuous perforated ribbons made somewhat in
the same way, visible and legible only to an expert, and reproductions by
the medium of this device would certainly not vitiate copyright.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="218a"></a>The law prior to 1909</p>

<p>"It may be observed that the existing law gives to the author or
proprietor of a musical composition the sole liberty not only of printing,
but of publishing, copying, vending, performing, or representing a musical
composition; that the statute does not restrict 'copying' either to a copy
of 'staff notation' or from or in any particular form, but prohibits in
general any copy of a musical composition; that there is no suggestion in
the statute that the copy must be one to be read, <i>e. g.</i>, a copy of
a sculpture; that any sound-record is in the wide sense as truly a copy of
a musical composition as a printed sheet, which is not a copy, in fact, of
the author's manuscript writing; and that as the roll has for its sole
purpose the performing by the aid of a mechanism useless without it, of a
musical composition, just as a printed sheet of music has the sole purpose
of the performing by the aid of the voice, the piano, or the orchestra, of
a musical composition, the maker and vendor of the roll is in exactly the
same position as the maker or vendor of a printed sheet of music.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="218b"></a>Manuscript and copies</p>

<p>"But even if phonograph and perforated records should not be
considered, as is sculpture, to be 'writings,' the arguments of the
opponents of this bill do not fit the case. The Constitution explicitly
provides that authors shall have <i>exclusive rights</i> to their
writings. This cannot mean exclusive rights to their written manuscripts,
for these are protected by common law and no constitutional provision was
necessary. <a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
219]</span>It meant and means evidently that authors shall have exclusive
rights to the benefits of their writings, the usufruct of the property
they have created, and that means practically a monopoly control over all
copies or reproductions from such writings, whether the copies are in
handwriting, printing, or any other form. A musical score is definitely a
writing, for it is even more than a literary manuscript, originally in the
personal handwriting of the composer himself, without the intervention of
a stenographer or a typewriting machine. Therefore, if the narrowest
meaning of the word 'writings' should be interpreted into the Constitution
such as would exclude sculptures and other works which are admittedly
proper and legal subjects of copyright, it would still specifically
include musical and dramatic as well as literary manuscripts. There is no
specification in the Constitution confining the exclusive rights over
writings to copies in handwriting or print or any other stated process of
reproduction; in fact, the Constitution does not use the word 'copyright'
or in any way limit by specification the comprehensiveness of the
exclusive rights Congress is thus authorized to secure. Indeed, Congress
in the copyright laws has interpreted the Constitution to cover the
several artistic or reproductive processes from time to time developed or
invented; thus in the law of 1865 the provisions of the copyright laws
were extended to include 'photographs,' which did not exist at the time of
the adoption of the Constitution&mdash;which word specifically means
'light-writings' as phonograph records specifically mean
'sound-writings.'</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="219"></a>Protection of the inventor<br />

<a name="220"></a>The counter argument</p>

<p>"The position taken by the American Copyright League is that an author
is literally entitled to the exclusive right, that is, the exclusive
<i>benefit</i>, in his writings, in whatever form the writings, that is,
his <a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
220]</span>recorded thoughts, can be reproduced for sale or gain. If Mark
Twain writes a book or Bronson Howard a play or Sousa or Victor Herbert a
musical composition or Millet makes a painting or French a statue, each is
equally entitled to whatever benefit inures from his creative genius. Mr.
Sousa has stated clearly that although Caruso has been paid
$3000&mdash;and the fact widely advertised&mdash;for singing into a
phonograph record, and his own band (not under his leadership) has also
been paid for playing his compositions and those of others into the
phonograph horn, he has never received as a musical composer one cent for
such use of his creations, though from twenty to a hundred of his
compositions are to be found on the catalogues of the several
manufacturers of mechanical instruments. Mr. J. Howlett Davis, who
properly appeared as an inventor in defense of his own inventions in
mechanical instruments, which he mistakenly believes would be rendered
useless if the copyright protection were extended to sound-records, really
asked that Congress should protect the thing which he had invented, and
compel users to pay for it, but should permit him to use the thought which
the musical composer had invented and expressed, without paying for it.
His argument analyzed presents an even stronger argument for the proposed
copyright bill than for the protection of patented inventions. When Mr.
Sousa buys a patented cornet he has paid for the use of it, but Mr. Sousa
makes no claim either to make another cornet like it or to play
copyrighted musical compositions for profit without payment or permission.
A piano, a pianola, a music roll or new form of mechanism, is patentable;
a musical composition as played on a piano by hand or by mechanism,
whether reproduced on a printed sheet or a mechanical roll, is
copyrightable; but each should have like <a name="Page_221"
id="Page_221"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 221]</span>protection. I speak
from specific knowledge as one who has taken out patents as well as
copyrights and as the active head for some years of the Edison
Illuminating Company of New York and a participant in successfully
defending the Edison lamp patents. Mr. Edison, both as an inventor and as
a manufacturer of his own inventions, has profited much more than a
million dollars from his patents, and would naturally be expected to be
foremost in upholding the right of authors to payment for their
brains."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="221"></a>Complete protection</p>

<p>The acceptance by most countries within the International Copyright
Union of the Berlin convention, without reservation on this question of
mechanical music, sets an example of complete protection of the musical
composer which it is hoped may be ultimately adopted by the United States
as well as by other countries.</p>

<h4>ARTISTIC COPYRIGHT</h4>

<p class="p2 sidenote"><a name="222"></a>Threefold value in art works</p>

<p>The artist-author, by the labor of his brain and hand, produces three
classes of property right or a threefold value: he receives recompense
from the sale of the original work made by his hand, or from the
exhibition of it, or from the reproduction and sale of copies. The new
American code is perhaps in advance of legislation in any other country in
the protection of the artist, for it assures to him separate values in the
right to sell his work and the right to reproduce and sell copies, neither
one of which rights is necessarily transferred with the other; it enables
him to copyright his original work before the reproduction of copies,
though it does not make absolutely clear whether the exhibition without
restriction of an uncopyrighted work results in dedication; and it
protects his right to control and profit from reproductions, with the
simplest possible copyright notice, not including date, though as to
lithographic and photo-engraving reproductions it requires manufacture in
this country. The literary, dramatic or musical author produces no value
in the original work itself, except as his fame may ultimately make his
manuscript valuable as an autograph, and in this respect the artist-author
has an advantage of practical importance in the general provision
separating the copyright from the right in the material object. On the
other hand, show-right or right of exhibition is not as specifically
treated or as clearly defined and protected as is playright or right of
performance in the case of drama or music. </p>

<p><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
223]</span>The copyright of works of the fine arts and cognate works is
specifically provided for in the code of 1909 by including as
subject-matter of copyright (sec. 5) the following divisions: "(f) Maps;
(g) Works of art; models or designs for works of art; (h) Reproductions of
a work of art; (i) Drawings or plastic works of a scientific or technical
character; (j) Photographs; (k) Prints and pictorial illustrations." It is
not intended to include under subsection (k) labels or prints of
advertising or commercial character which may be registered as trade-marks
under the Trade-Mark law in the Patent Office. The proprietor of a work of
art is given in addition to the general rights (sec. 1, a) the specific
rights (sec. 1, b) "to complete, execute, and finish it if it be a model
or design for a work of art."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="223b"></a>Copyright Office classification
definitions</p>

<p>The new Copyright Office Rules and Regulations, promulgated 1910,
define these classifications in the following language:</p>

<p>"11. <i>(f) Maps.</i>&mdash;This term includes all cartographical
works, such as terrestrial maps, plats, marine charts, star maps, but not
diagrams, astrological charts, landscapes, or drawings of imaginary
regions which do not have a real existence.</p>

<p>"12. <i>(g) Works of art.</i>&mdash;This term includes all works
belonging fairly to the so-called fine arts. (Paintings, drawings, and
sculpture.)</p>

<p>"Productions of the industrial arts utilitarian in purpose and
character are not subject to copyright registration, even if artistically
made or ornamented.</p>

<p>"No copyright exists in toys, games, dolls, advertising novelties,
instruments or tools of any kind, glassware, embroideries, garments,
laces, woven fabrics, or any similar articles.</p>

<p>"13. <i>(h) Reproductions of works of art.</i>&mdash;This term refers
to such reproductions (engravings, woodcuts, etchings, casts, etc.) as
contain in themselves an <a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 224]</span>artistic element distinct from that of the
original work of art which has been reproduced.</p>

<p>"14. <i>(i) Drawings or plastic works of a scientific or technical
character.</i>&mdash;This term includes diagrams or models illustrating
scientific or technical works, architects' plans, designs for engineering
work, etc.</p>

<p>"15. <i>(j) Photographs.</i>&mdash;This term covers all positive prints
from photographic negatives, including those from moving picture films
(the entire series being counted as a single photograph), but not
photogravures, half tones, and other photo-engravings.</p>

<p>"16. <i>(k) Prints and pictorial illustrations.</i>&mdash;This term
comprises all printed pictures not included in the various other classes
enumerated above.</p>

<p>"Articles of utilitarian purpose do not become capable of copyright
registration because they consist in part of pictures which in themselves
are copyrightable, e. g., puzzles, games, rebuses, badges, buttons,
buckles, pins, novelties of every description, or similar articles.</p>

<p>"Postal cards cannot be copyrighted as such. The pictures thereon may
be registered as 'prints or pictorial illustrations' or as 'photographs.'
Text matter on a postal card may be of such a character that it may be
registered as a 'book.'</p>

<p>"Mere ornamental scrolls, combinations of lines and colors, decorative
borders, and similar designs, or ornamental letters or forms of type are
not included in the designation 'prints and pictorial illustrations.'
Trademarks cannot be copyrighted nor registered in the Copyright
Office."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="224"></a>The question of exhibition</p>

<p>The new law does not specifically make clear the relation between the
exhibition of works of art and publication, or define whether or not
exhibition may constitute dedication to the public and thus prevent the
protection of the copyright thereafter. But in <a name="Page_225"
id="Page_225"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 225]</span>making copyright a
sequent to publication (sec. 9) and providing (sec. 2) "that nothing in
this Act shall be construed to annul or limit the right of the author or
proprietor of an unpublished work, at common law or in equity, to prevent
the copying, publication, or use of such unpublished work," it makes it at
least probable that the author of an artistic or cognate work who simply
exhibits, does not surrender the right to copyright. The trend of the
courts in recent decisions has been, as in the Werkmeister case, cited
below, to protect exhibited works, at least where any reservation of
rights could be construed into the circumstances of the exhibition; but it
is still uncertain whether the exhibition of a work of art at a public
museum where there is no regulation against copying or reservation by the
artist, might not constitute a dedication and thus prevent later
copyright.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="225a"></a>Protection of unpublished work</p>

<p>In providing however (sec. 11) specifically "that copyright may also be
had of the works of an author of which copies are not reproduced for sale,
by the deposit, with claim of copyright ... of a photographic print if the
work be a photograph; or of a photograph or other identifying reproduction
thereof if it be a work of art or a plastic work or drawing," it gives to
the artist or the author of a cognate work an easy means of protecting his
production beyond question; and he is not wise who neglects the simple
precaution provided in the law.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="225b"></a>Copyright notice</p>

<p>It is not made absolutely clear in the new law whether the copyright
notice must be attached to the original of a work of art; but again the
provision for protection is so simple that it is wise to take advantage of
the method of the law, by placing the copyright notice on the original.
The copyright notice may be in the form (sec. 18) "'Copyright' or the
abbreviation 'Copr.' accompanied by the name of <a name="Page_226"
id="Page_226"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 226]</span>the copyright
proprietor," the year of publication not being required in the case of an
artistic work. It is further provided that "in the case of copies of works
specified in subsections (f) to (k), inclusive, of section five of this
Act, the notice may consist of the letter C inclosed within a circle,
thus: ©, accompanied by the initials, monogram, mark, or symbol of the
copyright proprietor: <i>Provided</i>, That on some accessible portion of
such copies or of the margin, back, permanent base, or pedestal, or of the
substance on which such copies shall be mounted, his name shall
appear."</p>

<p>If the copyright notice is attached to the original, it is not made
clear whether it should be on the face of the work and visible to the
casual spectator; but again the wise artist will take an easy
precaution.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="226"></a>Deposit</p>

<p>It is further required (sec. 12) that "if the work is not reproduced in
copies for sale, there shall be deposited the copy, print, photograph, or
other identifying reproduction" required as above stated, "accompanied in
each case by a claim of copyright."</p>

<p>The new Copyright Office Rules and Regulations schedule (17) among
unpublished works that may be registered "(<i>c</i>) photographic prints;
(<i>d</i>) works of art (paintings, drawings, and sculpture), and
(<i>e</i>) plastic works," and states specifically as to the deposit in
such cases:</p>

<p>"19. (2) In the case of photographs, deposit one copy of a positive
print of the work. (Photo-engravings or photogravures are not photographs
within the meaning of this provision.)</p>

<p>"20. (3) In the case of works of art, models or designs for works of
art, or drawings or plastic works of a scientific or technical character,
deposit a photographic reproduction."</p>

<p>As deposit in the case of an unpublished work <a name="Page_227"
id="Page_227"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 227]</span>takes the place of
publication and deposit in the case of works reproduced for sale, there
can be no claim for statutory protection of an unpublished work of art
without the deposit of the identifying copy, and the general provision
(sec. 13) for fine and for voiding of copyright in the case of
non-deposit, has, of course, no bearing on unpublished works. Any action
or proceeding in respect to an unpublished work not registered by deposit
must therefore be under common law and not under statutory provision.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="227"></a>Summary of requirements</p>

<p>To sum up, the author of a work of art, who is exhibiting his painting
or statue or other work and not multiplying copies for sale, will assure
himself of full protection if before such exhibition he places on the
original work, in some visible but not obtrusive fashion, the letter C
inclosed in a circle with his name or mark, and deposits a photograph of
such work with the Librarian of Congress or in the mails addressed to him,
accompanied by a claim of copyright,&mdash;for which an application form
(J<sup><span class="tinier">2</span></sup>, "photograph not reproduced for
sale") is furnished on request, by the Copyright Office from
Washington,&mdash;with inclosure of one dollar.</p>

<p>As soon as the artist multiplies copies for sale, or permits
reproduction of his work, as in a newspaper report of an exhibition, for
instance, he must then take the precaution of depositing two copies of
such reproduction as provided in general by the act, and it is further
provided (sec. 18) "that on some accessible portion of such copies or of
the margin, back, permanent base, or pedestal, or of the substance on
which such copies shall be mounted, his name shall appear." In case two
copies are not so deposited, it is probable that a fine and forfeiture of
copyright would ultimately ensue, as indicated in section 13.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="228a"></a>Material and immaterial properties
distinct</p>

<p>It is specifically provided (sec. 41) that copyright <a name="Page_228"
id="Page_228"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 228]</span>is distinct from
the property in the material object, which accomplishes for the artist the
important result that when he sells his painting he does not transfer the
copyright, but retains that for himself unless he specifically contracts
with the buyer to include in the sale the copyright or the right to
copyright. This adopts into the law the decision of the courts that
copyright does not pass with a painting unless distinctly included in the
transfer. The provision (sec. 41) is specific that the copyright "is
distinct from the property in the material object copyrighted, and the
sale or conveyance, by gift or otherwise, of the material object shall not
of itself constitute a transfer of the copyright, nor shall the assignment
of the copyright constitute a transfer of the title to the material
object." Thus the author of a work of art has two separate properties, the
painting, statue or other work in itself, on the one hand, and the
copyright or the right to copyright on the other, neither of which is
transferred by the transfer of the other unless both are specifically
included in the transfer.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="228b"></a>Manufacturing clause covers
lithographs and photo-engravings<br />

Foreign subjects excepted</p>

<p>The copyright in certain classes of reproductions of works of art is
dependent however on manufacture in this country, as in the case of books.
This provision no longer includes photographs as in the preceding law, but
is confined specifically (sec. 15) to "text produced by lithographic
process, or photo-engraving process," "illustrations within a book
consisting of printed text and illustrations produced by lithographic
process, or photo-engraving process, and also to separate lithographs or
photo-engravings, except where in either case the subjects represented are
located in a foreign country and illustrate a scientific work or reproduce
a work of art." It is further provided that "in the case of the book ...
if the text be produced by lithographic process, or photo-engraving <a
name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
229]</span>process ... the copies so deposited shall be accompanied by an
affidavit ... that such process was wholly performed within the limits of
the United States." This affidavit, therefore, is not required in the case
of separate lithographs or photo-engravings. The manufacturing provisions
chiefly concern the publishers of books, but they imply that artists
cannot send works abroad to have reproductions made. But by the opinion of
January 9, 1911, approved by the Attorney-General, a design, drawing, or
painting made and located abroad intended as "the first step" for
lithographic reproduction, may be registered, if a "work of
art"&mdash;which question of fact is to be determined by the Register of
Copyrights; and such lithographic reproductions of it may be imported.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="229a"></a>German post cards</p>

<p>It was held by the Attorney-General January 27, 1910, that lithographic
reproductions of original paintings in the form of illustrated post cards
made in Germany, are subject to registration, provided the original
paintings may properly be classified as works of art; and thus importation
of such post cards would be permissible.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="229b"></a>Artistic merit unimportant</p>

<p>While there must be originality in a work of art, especially under
English law, this means little more than a prohibition of actual copying,
and as in the case of literary and dramatic works, artistic merit is of
little importance.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="229c"></a>Application forms<br />

<a name="230a"></a>Certificates</p>

<p>The Copyright Office furnishes without charge application forms,
lettered as indicated, for the following classes of art works: (F)
published map; (G) work of art (painting, drawing, or sculpture); or model
or design for a work of art; (H) reproduction of a work of art; (I)
drawing or plastic work of a scientific or technical character;
(J<sup><span class="tinier">1</span></sup>) photograph published for sale,
(J<sup><span class="tinier">2</span></sup>) photograph not reproduced for
sale; (K) print or pictorial <a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 230]</span>illustration. Thus the applicant should
send for application blank (G), if for an original work of art, (H), if
for a reproduction, or the proper blank in the other specified cases. But
it should be noted that it is both unnecessary and undesirable to apply
separately under different blanks as (G) and (H), since the single
copyright on the original work covers reproductions. Certificates are
returned by the Copyright Office on receipt of the application form and of
the statutory fee of one dollar, covering the same specified subjects.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="230b"></a>Term in unpublished work</p>

<p>When an original work of art is copyrighted, but is not published by
reproduction of copies for sale or distribution, it is uncertain under the
law, as in the case of dramatic and musical compositions, from what date
the copyright protection runs and whether the sole right of reproducing
copies for sale terminates at the end of a statutory term beginning with
the registration of the original work or with its publication by the
reproduction of copies for sale. The Copyright Office issues a certificate
of the registration of the original work as covering a period of
twenty-eight years and will doubtless base a renewal on the termination of
this term; and only a court decision will determine whether the copyright
of the original unpublished work exists in perpetuity until publication or
whether the right to reproduce copies for sale lapses with the termination
of twenty-eight or fifty-six years from the registration of the original
work.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="230c"></a>Date not required<br />

<a name="231a"></a>Re-copyright objectionable</p>

<p>The omission of the requirement of date in the copyright notice in the
case of a work of art is significant and important, although it has the
disadvantage that knowledge of the expiration of the term of copyright can
be had only by specific inquiry from the Copyright Office. It has been the
mistaken practice of more than one artist, under the old law, to enter <a
name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
231]</span>copyright on his original sketch or on his original work under
date of its beginning, again on the finished original under date of its
completion, and possibly again on reproductions under the date of the
first publication of copies; and when also the artist changed the name of
his work under these progressions, confusion became worse confounded. From
this superfluous zeal and mistaken carefulness, serious results have come,
as in Caliga <i>v. Inter-Ocean</i> Newspaper Co., decided in 1909 by the
U.&nbsp;S. Supreme Court through Justice Day, wherein an artist failed to
protect himself against an infringing reproduction, because he brought
suit under a second copyright which he had entered on finishing his
picture, instead of under the original and lawful copyright, under which
he had originally entered his work. The fact that by this second
copyrighting he laid claim to a longer term than the law allowed, made the
second copyright void and a suit under it of no avail. Under the new law
the author of a work of art is not only given specifically the exclusive
right "to complete, execute, and finish it if it be a model or design for
a work of art" as in the previous law, so that an artistic work is
protected by one copyright from design to completion and reproduction; but
he may also protect his original work during its progress or exhibition
before publication and thus safeguard his future right to control and
benefit from the multiplication of copies.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="231b"></a>Exhibition right transfer</p>

<p>In case of the sale of the original work of art, the right to exhibit,
of course, passes with the original, although the right to copyright and
reproduce copies is expressly reserved to the artist. In view of the
uncertainty whether the unrestricted public exhibition of a work of art
constitutes dedication and prevents copyright thereof, the carelessness of
the purchaser of the original might raise question as to the validity of
<a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
232]</span>later copyright of reproductions by the artist. It is therefore
unwise for an artist to sell the original of a work of art without
affixing to it the required copyright notice and depositing one copy of an
identifying photograph or print.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="232"></a>Early English decision</p>

<p>The leading case under English law as to exhibition is that of Turner
<i>v.</i> Robinson in the Irish Court of Chancery in 1860, previous to the
passage of the act of 1862 which first provided statutory copyright for
paintings, and interpretative therefore of common law. Turner's "Death of
Chatterton" had been reproduced in a magazine and exhibited at the Royal
Academy and in Manchester, and was thereafter exhibited for the purpose of
obtaining subscriptions for an engraving, in Dublin, where a photographer
copied it and published a stereoscopic reproduction. The Master of the
Rolls held that the painting had never been published because the
exhibitions were on condition that no copies should be made, and the
engraving in the magazine was only a rough representation and not a
publication of the picture. The Court of Appeal also held against the
defendant, but because of his breach of contract, and declined to decide
whether there had been publication in London or Manchester. The Lord
Chancellor, however, expressed the opinion that exhibition at the Academy,
though conditioned, was publication, though a private view in a studio
rather than a picture gallery would not be. The Court of Appeal did not
pass on the further opinion of the Master of the Rolls that the
publication of a print was not publication of the picture. These confusing
opinions left the question in very misty shape and the most important
interpretation of English practice has come from an American court.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="233"></a>The Werckmeister leading case</p>

<p>The latest and leading case as to exhibition is that of Werckmeister
<i>v.</i> American Lithograph Co., <a name="Page_233"
id="Page_233"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 233]</span>American Tobacco
Co., <i>et al.</i>, which was decided by the U.&nbsp;S. Supreme Court in
1907, in an opinion written by Justice Day. The English artist Sadler had
sold, in 1894, to Werckmeister of the Berlin Photographic Co. the
copyright in his picture "Chorus," which he exhibited at the Royal Academy
Exhibition of 1894, and the design had been reproduced by the American
Lithograph Co. for use on an American Tobacco Co. label, though the
photograph had been given protection by copyright. In reply to the claim
of the infringers that such exhibition constituted dedication to the
public, the Supreme Court's decision quoted from Slater on "The law
relating to copyright and trade-marks."</p>

<p class="sidenote">U.&nbsp;S. Supreme Court opinion</p>

<p>"It is a fundamental rule that to constitute publication there must be
such a dissemination of the work of art itself among the public as to
justify the belief that it took place with the intention of rendering such
work common property," the court adding, "and that author instances as one
of the occasions that does not amount to a general publication the
exhibition of a work of art at a public exhibition where there are by-laws
against copies or where it is tacitly understood that no copying shall
take place, and the public are admitted to view the painting on the
implied understanding that no improper advantage will be taken of the
privilege. We think this doctrine is sound and the result of the best
considered cases." The court said further: "We do not mean to say that the
public exhibition of a painting or statue where all might see and freely
copy it might not amount to publication within the statute, regardless of
the artist's purpose or notice of reservation of rights which he takes no
measure to protect."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="234a"></a>Unrestricted exhibition
hazardous</p>

<p>In fact, in Pierce &amp; Bushnell Co. <i>v.</i> Werckmeister, in 1896,
the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court of Appeals, through <a name="Page_234"
id="Page_234"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 234]</span>Judge Colt, had
held that the exhibition of Naujok's painting of St. Cecilia, in Berlin
and Munich, without copyright notice on the original work, constituted
publication and dedication, and therefore denied protection to
photographic copies thereafter copyrighted and published.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="234b"></a>Reservation on sale</p>

<p>That the sale of the original work of art as a material object does not
involve the transfer of the copyright is a direct application in the new
American code of previous judicial decisions. In Werckmeister <i>v.</i>
Springer Lith. Co., in 1894, where the defense contended that the
purchaser of a painting was the person authorized to become the copyright
proprietor, this contention was absolutely overruled, in the U.&nbsp;S.
Circuit Court in New York, by Judge Townsend. But it may nevertheless be
desirable to include in any contract of sale a specific reservation of
copyright, especially in the case of works executed for public authorities
or to be exhibited in a public place. In Dielman v. White, in 1900, Judge
Lowell in the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court in Massachusetts declined to enjoin
a photograph of certain mosaics by Dielman in the Library of Congress, the
original cartoon for which as sent to Venice, as well as the mosaic work
itself, bore copyright notice, on the ground that the correspondence with
the government constituting the contract, did not clearly reserve to the
artist the right to copyright and prevent copying,&mdash;though this
decision may be questioned.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="234c"></a>Publication construed</p>

<p>The courts are disposed to limit the definition of publication to
insure the fullest protection of an author's right. In Werckmeister
<i>v.</i> Springer Lith. Co. it was further held by Judge Townsend that
the printing in an exhibition catalogue of a cut of a painting was for the
information of patrons and was not publication. In the same case the
defense contended that the sale of <a name="Page_235"
id="Page_235"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 235]</span>an earlier replica
of the plaintiff's painting constituted a publication and forfeited
copyright, but the court held that the replica was not a copy but was made
beforehand to assist in the preparation of the painting afterward
copyrighted, and that there was no publication.</p>

<p>In Falk <i>v.</i> Gast, in 1893, where the defense claimed that the
copyright notice was omitted from published copies, referring to a sample
sheet of miniature reproductions sent to dealers for their information and
convenience, the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court of Appeals, through Judge
Shipman, held that this issue of sample sheets did not constitute
publication. This doctrine of limitation had a curious application in
Harper <i>v.</i> Shoppell, in 1886, in which Judge Wallace, in the
U.&nbsp;S. District Court, held, where an electrotyper had sold to a third
party an unauthorized electrotype of a copyrighted illustration, that the
copyright law was not violated because the illustration had not been
printed or published.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="235"></a>Danger of forfeiture</p>

<p>The artist-author or the proprietor of an artistic copyright should be
most careful to comply with the statutory requirements as to notice and
other formalities, as otherwise copyright may be forfeited. Several court
decisions indicate that the copyright notice should be placed on the
original when exhibited, even if copies are not then reproduced for sale;
and as the question is not made quite clear in the new code, it is wise to
follow this indication. In the original trial in 1902 of the Werckmeister
case, Judge Thomas in the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court held that the omission
of copyright notice from the exhibited original waived the copyright, but
his decision of the case was reversed by the U.&nbsp;S. Supreme Court on
other grounds as previously stated, and this particular point remains
unsettled. </p>

<p><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
236]</span> Copyright is not forfeited where a notice properly affixed has
been omitted in later use beyond the control of the copyright proprietor.
"If copied afterwards or put upon a new mount the complainant should not
suffer," said Judge Coxe in Falk <i>v.</i> Gast in reference to copies
from which the notice had been separated. In Bennett <i>v.</i> Carr, in
1899, the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court of Appeals, through Judge Thomas,
non-suited the complainant because he had not deposited a written
description, in addition to filing identifying copies, both formalities
being required under the old law.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="236"></a>Limited use and license</p>

<p>The principle is especially important regarding works of art that a
copyright proprietor may grant specific license for the limited use of his
work; and this has many times been upheld by judicial decisions. In the
American courts, such cases have usually been settled by preliminary
injunction, without further trial, so that most of the cases are
unreported in the law digests, as in that of Miles <i>v.</i> American News
Co., in 1898, where General Miles obtained a preliminary injunction
restraining the distribution by the defendants of "Remington's frontier
sketches," including illustrations made for and copyrighted in General
Miles' "Personal recollections." In the English case of Nicholls <i>v.</i>
Parker, in 1901, it was held that a license to print illustrations in the
<i>Graphic</i> did not permit their use in another periodical of the
defendant despite the defense of "custom of the trade," which the judge
characterized as "ridiculous." In the important case of Green <i>v. Irish
Independent</i>, the Court of Appeal held that the newspaper, though
acting "in good faith and without knowledge," was guilty of infringement
in printing an illustration sent to it as an advertisement which the
proprietor had not licensed for such use. Where, in Guggenheim <i>v.</i>
Leng, in <a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
237]</span>1896, the periodical <i>Sports</i> printed and sold as a
separate sheet an illustration licensed for use in the periodical, it was
held in the Queen's Bench Division that publication and sale of the
supplement separately from the paper was beyond the terms of the license
and therefore an infringement.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="237a"></a>Character, not method of use</p>

<p>Copyright in a work of art is dependent upon character rather than use.
"A picture is none the less a picture and none the less a subject of
copyright that it is used for an advertisement," said Justice Holmes in
the U.&nbsp;S. Supreme Court, in Bleistein <i>v.</i> Donaldson Lith. Co.,
in 1903, the leading case on this subject, in which three lithographs
designed for a circus poster were protected. In Mott <i>v.</i> Clow, in
1896, Judge Grosscup in the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court in Illinois had held
that illustrations, in this instance of bathtubs in a trade catalogue,
which "are mere advertisements," are not entitled to copyright; and in
Schumacher <i>v.</i> Wogram, in 1888, it had been held by Judge Wallace
that a picture of a young woman holding a bouquet intended for a cigar
label could not be protected as copyright, but should be registered as a
trade-mark. "The distinction here," said Judge Wallace, "seems to be that
a picture expressly intended as a label should be considered a trade-mark,
though a picture which may be used for a label is not for this reason
excluded from copyright." An artistic design for paper-box covers was held
copyrightable in 1910 in De Jonge <i>v.</i> Breuker &amp; Kessler, in the
U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court, by Judge McPherson, who also held that the same
subject could not be protected both under copyright and as trade-mark.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="237b"></a>Illustration</p>

<p>That an illustration of a person, incident or scene in a copyright work
is not an infringement of its copyright, was indicated in 1909 in Harper
<i>v.</i> Kalem Co., in the opinion of the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in <a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
238]</span>New York, through Judge Ward, who said: "As pictures only
represent the artist's idea of what the author has expressed in words,
they do not infringe a copyrighted book or drama and should not be
enjoined." That illustrations may be protected as part of a book without
reference to the engravings act, was held in Marshall <i>v.</i> Bull, in
1901, in the English Court of Appeal, which held also that though
electrotype blocks had been legally sold, unauthorized reproduction from
such blocks constituted infringement.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="238a"></a>Description of artistic work</p>

<p>Likewise, a description in words of a copyrighted work of art is
probably permissible without infringement of copyright, when the work is
published or publicly exhibited. But this does not hold good in the case
of an unpublished or privately exhibited work, as was held in 1849 in the
case of Prince Albert <i>v.</i> Strange, where a descriptive catalogue of
unpublished etchings by Queen Victoria and the Prince Consort was
enjoined, as well as the exhibition of prints therefrom unlawfully
obtained.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="238b"></a>Portraits</p>

<p>In the case of portraits, whether by painting, sculpture or
photography, an important question as to ownership arises. A portrait paid
for by the subject or a person other than the artist is the property, for
copyright as well as other purposes, exclusively of that person; but if an
artist produces a portrait at his own expense, even if by the suggestion
of another person, the right to copyright remains with the artist. The
general principle was best stated by Judge Wheeler in 1894, in the
U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court in New York, in Press Pub. Co. <i>v.</i> Falk,
where the <i>World</i> was held to have infringed the copyright in the
photograph of an actress, copyrighted by the photographer and not paid for
by her, though a complimentary copy, given to the actress, had been sent
by her to the newspaper. "When a person has a negative taken <a
name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 239]</span>and
photograph made, for pay, in the usual course, the work is done for the
person so procuring it to be done, and the negative, so far as it is a
picture or capable of producing pictures of that person, and all
photographs made from it, belong to that person; and neither the artist
nor any one else has any right to make pictures from the negative or copy
the photographs, if not otherwise published, for any one else. But when a
person submits himself or herself as a public character to a photographer
for the taking of a negative, and the making of photographs therefrom for
the photographer, the negative and the right to make photographs from it
belong to him. He is the author and proprietor of the photograph, and may
perfect the exclusive right to make copies by copyright." The same
principle was upheld in the closely similar English case of Ellis
<i>v.</i> Ogden, in 1894, by Justice Collins in the Queen's Bench
Division. But in the case of Ellis <i>v.</i> Marshall, in 1895, Justice
Charles in the same court held that where two actors had been invited by a
photographer to sit for him in costume and some photographs had also been
taken in plain clothes, of which the actors purchased copies, they were
entitled to authorize publication in a magazine. It may be noted that New
York and other states have statutes forbidding portraiture of persons
without their consent; but this prohibition would probably not apply to
photographing of a crowd, unless the portrait of a special person were
lifted out or made prominent. A photographer may not exhibit a photograph
of a patron, as in his shop window, without the sitter's consent.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="239"></a>Right of employer</p>

<p>The employer of an artist in other work as well as portraiture may
become <i>ipse facto</i> the copyright proprietor. In 1871, in Stannard
<i>v.</i> Harrison, where a wall map had been made by an engraver from
rough <a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
240]</span>sketch and material and from directions given by the plaintiff,
the English Court of Chancery, through Vice-Chancellor Bacon, held: "That
the plaintiff cannot draw himself is a matter wholly unimportant if he has
caused other persons to draw for him. He invents the subject of the design
beyond all question ... this is a work of diligence, industry, and for
aught I know of genius on the part of the plaintiff." This case, which
arose under the engravings acts in England, where an engraving may be
copyrighted by an employer,&mdash;though the engraver of his own original
design is the only person entitled to copyright,&mdash;is of wide bearing
throughout artistic copyright. On the other hand, in 1898, in Bolton
<i>v.</i> London Exhibitions Co., Justice Mathew in the Queen's Bench
Division held that the employer, who had given to the engraver only a
"general idea" of what he desired, was not the party liable for
infringement.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="240"></a>Photographs</p>

<p>Photographs, a modern development since the early copyright laws, were
first included with negatives in the American act of 1865, in respect to
which the action of Congress was upheld by the U.&nbsp;S. Supreme Court in
1884 in the decisive case of Burrow-Giles Lith. Co. <i>v.</i> Sarony, and
in the English fine arts copyright act of 1862. They are specifically
named (sec. 5, j) in the new American code, and are included specifically
or impliedly under copyright protection in most countries. The peculiar
circumstance that the skill of the photographic artist is not necessarily
shown in the composition of the picture taken, but more usually in the
selection of subject or point of view and treatment in the process, leads
to complexities as to authorship, ownership, etc. It is unnecessary and
indeed undesirable to copyright separately a photograph of a copyrighted
work, of which the general copyright is comprehensive of all
reproductions, <a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 241]</span>but the original copyright notice including
the name of the artist must appear on each photograph or its mount. An
original photograph of an uncopyrighted or uncopyrightable subject may be
copyrighted as a photograph, as was held with respect to natural scenery
in 1903, in Cleland <i>v.</i> Thayer, in the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, where a colored photograph of a Colorado pass was protected.
Where a photographer had posed a woman and a child characteristically,
Judge Wheeler in the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court in New York held, in 1891,
in Falk <i>v.</i> Brett Lith. Co., where defendant had merely reversed the
photograph in a lithographic reprint, that the photograph was
copyrightable and that the photographer was the author. And this doctrine,
that the posing and treatment of a photograph subject gave justification
for copyright, was also upheld in the case of a portrait of an actress in
the same year in Falk <i>v.</i> Gast by Judge Coxe. In the English case of
Bolton <i>v.</i> Aldin <i>et al.</i>, in 1895, Justice Grantham in the
Queen's Bench Division held that the photograph of a tiger was infringed
by a drawing from the photograph published in the <i>Sketch</i> magazine.
But the copyrighting of a photograph of an uncopyrighted subject cannot
prevent the photographing of the same subject independently by others, nor
can the use of a "general idea" be prevented. Under the new American code,
the fee for registering a photograph is but fifty cents, if a certificate
is not desired, and the new Copyright Office Rules hold that in moving
picture films only one registration is requisite, "the entire series being
counted as a single photograph."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="241"></a>Tableaux vivants and moving
pictures</p>

<p>Whether living pictures, <i>tableaux vivants</i>, infringe a work of
art, is a difficult question, determinable only by the circumstances of
each case. Moving pictures telling a dramatic story may infringe a
dramatic or <a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
242]</span>even literary work, as well as possibly a work of art, as was
decided in the case of Harper <i>v.</i> Kalem Co. But the House of Lords,
in 1894, in the case of Hanfstaengl <i>v.</i> Baines, where the proprietor
of the copyright in paintings sued the proprietors of the <i>Graphic</i>
for reproducing by sketches living pictures exhibited at a music hall,
patterned after the paintings, decided that the word "design" in the
English law did not cover the <i>tableaux</i> at the music hall. It is
probable, however, that an exact reproduction, as nearly as may be, of a
painting at a public place, might be held an infringement. In 1903 the
Circuit Court of Appeals through Judge Buffington, in Edison <i>v.</i>
Lubin, overruled the defense that each picture making up a moving picture
series should be separately registered for copyright. But separable parts
of a composite design, when used separately, must bear separate copyright
notice, as was held in 1910 in De Jonge <i>v.</i> Breuker &amp; Kessler by
Judge McPherson in the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Exclusions and inclusions construed</p>

<p>A shadow-trick perforated card, giving an outline of the picture "Ecce
Homo" when held between a light and a screen, was held by Vice-Chancellor
Bacon, in Cable <i>v.</i> Marks, in 1882, not to be subject of copyright.
Playing cards have been included as prints by an English decision.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="242"></a>Architectural works</p>

<p>Architectural works are not protected as such under the American code,
the decision of the Congressional Committees being adverse to this
proposal. They are specifically included in the new British code. It is
possible that they might be included under the general designation of
works of art, and drawings or models for buildings might be copyrighted as
"drawings or plastic works of a scientific or technical character." The
question, however, is one of much doubt. In 1903, in Wright <i>v.</i>
Eisle, the Appellate <a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 243]</span>Division of the N. Y. Supreme Court,
through Judge Woodward, held, where an architect had filed plans with the
building department which he claimed were copied in a house of the
defendant, which plans had not been copyrighted, that the filing of the
plans in a public office constituted publication and as there were no
copyrighted copies, there was no case at common or copyright law.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="243a"></a>Copy of a copy</p>

<p>A copy of a copy is an infringement of the original work and
incidentally of the direct copy, unless the latter is published without
proper copyright notice by authority of the proprietor of copyright in the
original. This was held in 1892, in Lucas <i>v.</i> Williams, by the
Queen's Bench, where a photograph from an engraving was held an
infringement of the original painting; and the decision of Judge McPherson
in the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court in Pennsylvania non-suiting, in Champney
<i>v.</i> Haag, in 1903, the proprietor of a copyright painting because
the offending photograph infringed only the copyrighted photograph from
which it was directly taken, is not considered good law. A photograph may
infringe the copyright in statuary, as was held in 1907, in Bracken
<i>v.</i> Rosenthal, in the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="243b"></a>Alterations</p>

<p>As to altered copies and alterations, there have been many judicial
decisions, the gist of which is that a copy is not less an infringement
because it alters details, provided there is copying of a substantial
part; that a copy in another medium not exactly reproducing the original
or a copy of it, is nevertheless an infringement; that a substantial
alteration, or adaptation of an existing work, may in itself be
copyrightable, but that slight alterations will not justify the
copyrighting of a work in the public domain; and that an artist has the
right to prevent alteration of his original work by a subsequent owner, as
involving <a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
244]</span> damage to his professional reputation. Where a copyrighted
portrait of Lillian Russell was combined with a portrait of another
actress, the composite photograph was held to be a violation of the
copyright, in Springer Lith. Co. <i>v.</i> Falk, in 1894, by the
U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court of Appeals, through Judge Lacombe. So in the
English case of Bolton <i>v.</i> London Exhibitions Co., in 1898, where a
lithographer copied the outline of a lion from a copyrighted photograph,
and filled in details from natural histories in making a circus poster,
Justice Mathew in the Queen's Bench Division held that there had been
reproduction of the photograph and that a work of art had been "vulgarized
unlawfully." Where certain etchings and engravings had been copied by the
Brooklyn Photogravure Co., omitting the tints, plate mark and title, it
was held in 1892, in Fishel <i>v.</i> Lueckel, by Judge Townsend in the
U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court in New York that this was an infringement; said
Judge Townsend: "The appropriation of a part of the work is no less an
infringement than the appropriation of the whole, provided 'the alleged
infringing part contains any substantial repetitions of any material parts
which are original and distinctive." And where a photograph of Julia
Marlowe was reproduced in a lithograph, with many points of dissimilarity,
some of them because of difference in process, it was held in Falk
<i>v.</i> Donaldson Lith. Co., in 1893, by Judge Townsend in the
U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court in New York, that the differences did not
constitute a defense. In Dr. Gaunsaulus's book, "The Man of Galilee,"
well-known pictures were altered substantially and artistically, as by the
omission of a spinning wheel from a picture of the Nativity. Copies made
from these illustrations were enjoined, though the original pictures were
non-copyrighted, in Monarch Book Co. <i>v.</i> Neil, in 1900, by <a
name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
245]</span>Judge Grosscup in the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court in Illinois. But
a slight alteration, by the addition on the negative of a cane, thus put
into the hands of a person in a photograph not copyrighted in its original
form, was held not to justify copyright, in Snow <i>v.</i> Laird, in 1900,
by Judge Woods in the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court of Appeals. In the N. Y.
Supreme Court, in the common law case of Dodge <i>v.</i> Allied Arts Co.,
in 1903, where the plaintiff had painted four historical scenes on
commission which the defendants proposed to have altered, an injunction
pending suit was granted by Judge McCall, thus upholding the common law or
equity right of an artist to be protected against such misuse of his
work.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="245a"></a>Remedies</p>

<p>For the infringement of a work of art the copyright proprietor is
entitled (sec. 25) to an injunction, the forfeiture of infringing copies
and to damages "as well as all the profits ... or in lieu of actual
damages and profits such damages as to the court shall appear to be just,"
not less than $250 nor more than $5000, except that "in the case of a
newspaper reproduction of a copyrighted photograph such damages shall not
exceed $200 nor be less than $50." These damages, within the limits
stated, may be assessed by the court in the case of painting, statue or
sculpture at ten dollars, and in the case of any other works at one
dollar, "for every infringing copy made or sold by or found in the
possession of the infringer or his agents or employees." Under the old
law, damages were confined to copies found in possession, and the courts
were constrained to apply this literally though in several recorded cases
with evident injustice.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="245b"></a>Artistic copyright term</p>

<p>Copyright in artistic works in the United States has always been
covered under the general copyright acts, including the code of 1909
providing for copyright for twenty-eight and renewal for a second <a
name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
246]</span>twenty-eight years, and this is true also in Canada and
Newfoundland, where the term is for twenty-eight with renewal for fourteen
years. The Australian code of 1905 covers artistic copyright specifically
in part IV of the act, which provides for the general term of forty-two
years from "the making of the work" or life and seven years, whichever the
longer, but confines it to artistic work "which is made in Australia."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="246"></a>British practice</p>

<p>Artistic copyright in Great Britain, on the contrary, has been
protected by several concurrent acts beginning with the engraving
copyright acts of 1734 and 1767 and including the prints copyright act of
1777, the sculpture copyright act of 1814, the prints and engravings
copyright (Ireland) act of 1836 and the fine arts copyright act of 1862
covering paintings, drawings and photographs, previously
unprotected,&mdash;all forming part of the English law until repealed by
the new code. Under these several laws, the copyright term for paintings,
drawings and photographs has been the life of the author and seven years,
for engravings twenty-eight years from first publication and for sculpture
fourteen years from first publishing and renewal for fourteen years. Under
the act of 1862&mdash;which did not afford protection outside the United
Kingdom, as was affirmed by the Privy Council in 1903, upholding a
Canadian decision, in Graves <i>v.</i> Gorrie&mdash;copyright in artistic
works began with the making of the work wherever made (except that a
foreigner must be resident in England apparently at the time of making)
and did not depend upon publication; but the international copyright act
of 1844 nevertheless denied protection in Great Britain where a work was
first published in a country outside of treaty relations. Registration at
Stationers' Hall, at a cost of one shilling, has been a prerequisite to
protection. The right to copyright <a name="Page_247"
id="Page_247"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 247]</span>lapsed when the
original work was sold by the artist without previous registration or
written reservation, a provision applied in 1909 in Hunter <i>v.</i>
Clifford.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="247a"></a>Sculpture provisions</p>

<p>An original work of sculpture was protected only if first published
within the British dominions, if by a British subject or resident,
provided it bore the proprietor's name and date of first publication; and
renewal for a second fourteen years was possible only if the author was
then alive and held the copyright. Toy soldiers, artistically modeled,
were protected in England as a work of sculpture by Justice Wright in
Britain <i>v.</i> Hanks, in 1902. Common law protected until and statute
law after publication, <i>i. e.</i> when the public in general is first
permitted to view the work.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="247b"></a>Engraving provisions</p>

<p>An engraving was protected in Great Britain and Ireland, if first
published (and probably also made) within the British dominions, provided
it bore the proprietor's name and date of publication. Prints, as by
lithography or otherwise, were included with engravings; maps, charts and
plans were, however, included as books under the general copyright act.
Also engravings which are part of a book enjoy the wider protection of the
general copyright act. The sale of the plate of an engraving probably does
not transfer the copyright, unless intention to do so is clearly
evident.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="247c"></a>The new British code</p>

<p>The new British code includes as an "artistic work" under the general
copyright provisions, "works of painting, drawing, sculpture and artistic
craftsmanship, and architectural works of art and engravings and
photographs." Architectural works are protected only as regards artistic
character or design as distinguished from process or methods of

<p class="sidenote"><a name="248a"></a>Foreign countries</p>

<p>Works of art are protected in most foreign countries either impliedly
or specifically under general copyright legislation, although sometimes by
special laws. France covers artistic works "whatever may be the merit, use
or destination of the work"; the Scandinavian countries include
specifically drawings, etc., "not works of the fine arts"; in India
copyright is extended in industrial designs to "some peculiar shape or
form given an article, but not the article itself." Architectural works
are protected in France, Luxemburg and Brazil, but in most countries only
architectural plans, drawings, designs, figures, or models and not
buildings are covered. Geographical and topographical drawings and
technical drawings, maps and charts, illustrations, engravings, in some
cases lithographs, photographs, and negatives are among classes specified
in many countries. In some countries the term of copyright is different in
the case of artistic works. Luxemburg has the peculiar provision that
portraits may not be reproduced until twenty years after the death of the
person portrayed. Photographs are in several countries protected for a
shorter term, frequently five years from taking, publication or
registration as the case may be; in Norway the copyright may not extend
beyond the death of the photographer.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="248b"></a>Berne convention, 1886</p>

<p>When the International Copyright Union was created at Berne in 1886,
artistic works were conjoined with literary works under like protection
throughout the convention and they were specified (art. IV) as covering
"works of design, painting, sculpture, and engraving; lithographs,
illustrations, geographical charts; plans, sketches, and plastic works
relative to geography, topography, architecture, <a name="Page_249"
id="Page_249"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 249]</span>or science in
general; in fact, every production whatsoever in the ... artistic domain
which can be published by any mode of impression or reproduction." In the
final protocol it was specifically provided: "(1) As regards article IV,
it is agreed that those countries of the Union where the character of
artistic works is not refused to photographs, engage to admit them to the
benefits of the Convention, from the date of its coming into effect. They
are, however, not bound to protect the authors of such works further than
is permitted by their own legislation, except in the case of international
engagements already existing, or which may hereafter be entered into by
them. It is understood that an authorized photograph of a protected work
of art shall enjoy legal protection in all the countries of the Union, as
contemplated by the said Convention, for the same period as the principal
right of reproduction of the work itself subsists, and within the limits
of private arrangements between those who have legal rights."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="249"></a>Paris declaration; 1896</p>

<p>In the amendatory act adopted at Paris in 1896, the final protocol of
1886 was modified respecting architectural and photographic works as
follows (1, a, b): "In the countries of the Union in which protection is
accorded not only to architectural designs, but to the actual works of
architecture, those works are admitted to the benefit of the provisions of
the Convention of Berne and of the present additional act.</p>

<p>"Photographic works, and those obtained by similar processes, are
admitted to the benefit of the provisions of these acts, in so far as the
domestic legislation allows this to be done, and according to the measure
of protection which it gives to similar national works.</p>

<p>"It is understood that the authorized photograph <a name="Page_250"
id="Page_250"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 250]</span>of a protected work
of art enjoys legal protection in all the countries of the Union, within
the meaning of the Convention of Berne and the present additional act, as
long as the principal right of reproduction of this work itself lasts, and
within the limits of private conventions between those who have legal
rights."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="250a"></a>Berlin convention, 1908</p>

<p>In the Berlin convention of 1908, artistic works were defined (art. 2,
par. 1) by specification as "drawings, paintings; works of architecture
and sculpture; engravings and lithographs; illustrations; geographical
charts; plans, sketches and plastic works relating to geography,
topography, architecture, or the sciences,"&mdash;thus covering
architectural works under general copyright. It was further provided by
the convention of 1908 (art. 2, par. 4) that "works of art applied to
industry are protected so far as the domestic legislation of each country
allows." And article 3 provided: "The present Convention applies to
photographic works and to works obtained by any process analogous to
photography. The contracting countries are pledged to guarantee protection
to such works."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="250b"></a>Exhibition not publication</p>

<p>By the interpretative declaration adopted at Paris in 1896, it was
specifically provided (sec. 2): "By <i>published</i> works must be
understood works actually issued to the public in one of the countries of
the Union. Consequently,... the exhibition of a work of art, does not
constitute publication in the sense of the aforementioned Acts." In the
Berlin convention of 1908 it was similarly provided (art. 4, par. 4) that
"the exhibition of a work of art and the construction of a work of
architecture do not constitute publication."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="250c"></a>Pan American Union</p>

<h4>INFRINGEMENT OF COPYRIGHT: PIRACY, "FAIR USE" AND "UNFAIR
COMPETITION"</h4>

<p class="p2 sidenote"><a name="251a"></a>Piracy</p>

<p>The word "piracy," since that gentle craft has disappeared from the
high seas, has come commonly into use to mean free-booting with reference
to literary property. In this sense it is used as early as 1771 by
Luckombe in his history of printing, in which he says: "They ... would
suffer by this act of piracy, since it was likely to prove a very bad
edition." It was especially applied in America more or less jocularly in
the days when there was no legal protection for works by English authors,
to the reprinting chiefly of English novels without authority from or
payment to their authors, when publishers whose imprints were chiefly on
such reprints were commonly known as pirates. This secondary meaning has
been accepted by the dictionary makers, and the use by English law
authorities, and now in the new American code, of the phrases "pirated
works" and "piratical copies," gives the word specific legal
<i>status</i>. It is the comprehensive term now in common and legal use to
mean the stealing of an author's work by reprinting it in full or in
substantial part without the authority of the copyright proprietor, and is
in fact an infringement at wholesale or otherwise of the author's
exclusive right. This is of course prohibited by the law to the full
extent of its jurisdiction and is punishable as prescribed in the law.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="251b"></a>Test of piracy</p>

<p>"The true test of piracy," said Judge Shipman in the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit
Court in 1875, in Banks <i>v.</i> McDivitt, is "whether the defendant has
in fact used the plan, <a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 252]</span>arrangements and illustrations as the model
of his own book, with colorable alterations and variations, or whether his
work is the result of his own labor, skill and use of common materials and
common sources." Judge Story said in 1841, in Folsom <i>v.</i> Marsh: "If
so much is taken that the value of the original is sensibly diminished, or
the labours of the original author are substantially, to an injurious
extent, appropriated by another, that is sufficient in point of law to
constitute a piracy <i>pro tanto</i>. The entirety of the copyright is the
property of the author and it is no defence that another person has
appropriated a part and not the whole of any property."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="252"></a>Infringement in specific meaning</p>

<p>Infringement is commonly taken to mean specific invasion of the
author's rights rather than wholesale piracy; and the question of what is
infringement or "literary larceny" is more often a question of the
interpretation of the facts than the construction of the statute. The
legal cases arising under infringement constitute a very large proportion
of copyright litigation, demanding as they do judicial determination as to
the acts complained of in each particular case. It is therefore impossible
in this volume to give citations or references for the hundreds of cases
recorded in the law reports or in the various works on copyright, but it
may be noted that the foot-note citations in MacGillivray's "Law of
copyright" cover a very large number of American as well as English cases.
No treatise on copyright can apply, however, in advance, the general
principles of copyright to the infinite variety of possible cases; and
only generalizations and a few illustrative cases can here be given.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="253a"></a>Questions of fact and intent</p>

<p>Infringement is a question of fact rather than of intent. It is not a
valid defense that the infringer is ignorant; nor, on the other hand, can
any one be held for intention to infringe, where the act of infringement
<a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
253]</span>has not been accomplished. The new American code, nevertheless,
recognizes knowledge and intent in certain cases of punishment or damages
by the use of the words "willfully" and "knowingly." The letter of the law
is in general that the infringer must be held responsible and must make
good any damages suffered by the copyright proprietor, but proof that he
had no guilty knowledge or intent may effect mitigation of punitive
damages. The trend of court decisions and of judicial opinion does not
seem to be evident and consistent in this development; but it may perhaps
be said that while copyright law is more closely applied from the letter
of the statutes, in the legal aspect, the principles of equity have been
given freer play where the statute is not specific and definite. In 1899,
in Green <i>v. Irish Independent</i>, the English Court of Appeal held
that the proprietors of a newspaper who had printed an advertisement
containing an illustration which the advertiser had license to use only
for specified purposes, were liable for penalties, though they did not
know that the illustration was copyrighted; and in 1902, in American Press
Assoc. <i>v.</i> Daily Story Pub. Co., the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court of
Appeals held the defendants liable, though they had innocently copied from
a newspaper reprint which had inadvertently omitted the copyright notice.
But in 1898 Justice Mathew, in Bolton <i>v</i>. London Exhibitions,
declined to hold the defendants punishable, because they did not know that
the lithographer from whom they had ordered a poster had infringed the
copyright of a photograph.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="253b"></a>"Fair use"</p>

<p>"Fair use" means quotation from or other use of an author's work within
the evident meaning or judicial construction of the copyright statute, and
is the usual answer of the defendant to a complaint that he has taken
without authority some portion of the author's <a name="Page_254"
id="Page_254"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 254]</span>work or utilized in
some way the result of the author's labors. The borderland between
infringement and "fair use" is peculiarly and necessarily one of
uncertainty, not so much because of ambiguity in the statute as of
difficulty in determining the extent of use within which it is said <i>non
curat lex</i>. No statute can be so clear or so complete as to obviate
questions of this kind. In general there must be copying of a material or
substantial part. What is a material or substantial part, constituting
infringement, is a difficult question of fact.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="254a"></a>Principle of infringement</p>

<p>"Copying is not confined to literal repetition," said Judge Clifford,
in Lawrence <i>v.</i> Dana, in the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court in 1869, "but
includes also the various modes in which the matter of any publication may
be adopted, imitated, or transferred, with more or less colorable
alterations to disguise the source from which the material was derived;
nor is it necessary that the whole, or even the larger portion of the
work, should be taken in order to constitute an invasion of copyright."
The Chancery Division, through Lord Chief Justice Alverstone, took the
extreme course in Trengrouse <i>v.</i> "Sol" Syndicate, in 1901, of
holding a work an infringement, though less than a page was taken from the
plaintiff's football guide.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="254b"></a>Infringement by indirect
copying</p>

<p>Infringement may be by indirect as well as by direct copying. In the
case of Cate <i>v.</i> Devon in 1889, in the Chancery Court, the defense
that the copying was not from the original copyright work but from a
newspaper reprint, was rejected. Infringement may be through quite a
different medium from the original; thus a shorthand reproduction of a
lecture on "The dog as the friend of man," published in a text-book of
shorthand, was held in the Chancery case of Nichols <i>v.</i> Pitman, in
1884, to be an infringement of the lecture as much as if in ordinary type.</p>

<p class="sidenote"> <a name="255a"></a>Exceptions from infringement</p>

<p><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
255]</span>The doctrine of infringement cannot be invoked to obtain
monopoly of any particular subject, and the authorized biographer of
President Garfield was denied relief in 1889, in Gilmore <i>v.</i>
Anderson, when he sought to prevent the publication of a life of Garfield
by another writer. Nor will mere similarity of treatment of the same
subject constitute infringement. A copyright owner cannot prevent another
person from publishing the matter contained in his book, if invented or
collected independently, or from making "fair use" of its contents. Two
map-makers, collecting at first hand the same <i>data</i>, would naturally
make the same map, and each would equally be entitled to copyright. In
this respect, copyright law differs from patent law, where a first use
bars others from the same field. It has even been held that the collected
material might be used by a second compiler as a guide in a second
compilation, if subjected to original verification, as in the case of a
street directory. But in the case of rival Boston directories in 1905, the
U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court of Appeals held, in Sampson &amp; Murdock Co.
<i>v.</i> Seaver Radford Co., that a verification by actual canvass from a
list of discrepancies made up from the earlier work was beyond fair
use.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="255b"></a>Infringement by abridgment and
compilation</p>

<p>Abridgments were construed by early English decisions not to be
infringements, and this precedent was followed, reluctantly and often with
protest, in later cases by English and American judges, as set forth in
the chapter on subject-matter. Later copyright provisions,&mdash;as by use
of the word "<i>retranchements</i>" in the Berne-Berlin conventions, and
the specific authorization in the American code "to make any other version
thereof," and for copyright of an abridgment of a work in the public
domain,&mdash;directly or by implication, make abridgment an infringement
and free the courts to take this view. <a name="Page_256"
id="Page_256"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 256]</span>Compilations also
constitute infringement if they extract substantial parts of a copyright
work, beyond the limits of "fair use," or even if they adopt the plan or
arrangement or bodily transfer the material of a copyright compilation of
non-copyright matter.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="256a"></a>Abridged compilations</p>

<p>A curious complaint of infringement by abridgment was made in Gabriel
<i>v.</i> McCabe, in 1896, before Judge Grosscup in the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit
Court in Illinois, where the plaintiff had licensed the use of a copyright
song, "When the roll is called up yonder," in a collection of religious
poetry, "The finest of the wheat, no. 2," published by the defendant, who
included the song also in an abridged edition of this collection and in a
combined edition of this and another collection. Judge Grosscup held that:
"Future editions of a book may contain a composition published in an
earlier edition by license, even though parts of the earlier edition are
omitted.... To hold otherwise would practically forbid any new editions of
books of compilations, for the consent of all the authors contributing
could not, in many instances, be obtained." But if the collection had been
so abridged as to result in the publication of the song alone as sheet
music, it would have been an unfair use under the license.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="256b"></a>Separation of infringing parts</p>

<p>The general principles as to quotation beyond "fair use" were well laid
down by Lord Chancellor Eldon, in the early English case of Mawman
<i>v.</i> Tegg, in 1826: "If the parts which have been copied cannot be
separated from those which are original, without destroying the use and
value of the original matter, he who has made an improper use of that
which did not belong to him must suffer the consequences of so doing. If a
man mixes what belongs to him with what belongs to me, and the mixture be
forbidden by law, he must again separate them, and he must bear all the
mischief and loss which the separation may occasion. <a name="Page_257"
id="Page_257"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 257]</span>If an individual
chooses in any work to mix my literary matter with his own, he must be
restrained from publishing the literary matter which belongs to me; and if
the parts of the work cannot be separated, and if by that means the
injunction, which restrained the publication of my literary matter,
prevents also the publication of his own literary matter, he has only
himself to blame."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="257a"></a>Law digests</p>

<p>The difficult question of the extent to which a compiler may utilize
the materials of another has come especially to the front in the American
courts with reference to law digests and reports, within recent years. In
1896, in Mead <i>v.</i> West Pub. Co., concerning rival annotated editions
of "Stephen on pleading," then out of copyright, where the defendant's
editor admitted having clipped the text from the complainant's edition and
having obtained some ideas or suggestions from it, Judge Lochren, in the
U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court in Minnesota, held that there was no infringement
because non-copyright matter could not be protected in a copyright work
from such clipping, because the defendant's notes were original even
though suggested from the other, and because the few errors and citations
in common were immaterial since there were many new citations and the work
was on the whole the result of original research. That bodily transfer of
citations is beyond "fair use" was emphasized by Judge Ray in White
<i>v.</i> Bender, in 1911.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="257b"></a>Proof from common errors</p>

<p>As to proof from common errors, it had been held in 1895, in the case
of Chicago Dollar Directory Co. <i>v.</i> Chicago Directory Co., that the
later work, containing sixty-seven errors found in the other, was
evidently an infringement of the earlier compilation. In Bisel <i>v.</i>
Welsh, <i>Re</i> Brightly Pennsylvania reports, in 1904, the U.&nbsp;S.
Circuit Court held that repetitions of errors in citations were evidence
of infringement <a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 258]</span>by the author of his own reports published
under an earlier contract by the plaintiffs; and in 1911, in Shepard
<i>v.</i> Taylor, Judge Hazel held that common errors were <i>prima
facie</i> proof of infringement.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="258a"></a>Infringement in part<br />

<a name="258b"></a>No infringement of piracies or frauds</p>

<p>In the important case of West Pub. Co. <i>v.</i> Lawyers' Pub. Co.,
where a collection of selected cases and a general digest were alleged to
be infringements of the plaintiff's reports and monthly digests, Judge
Coxe in the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court enjoined 303 proved "instances of
piracy" but not the remaining portions of the digest, but in 1897 the
U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court of Appeals, through Judge Lacombe, held that
under such circumstances the burden of proof must be on the unfair user
and broadened the decision by issuing an injunction against the work as a
whole, excepting those parts which were public property. In 1910, in Park
&amp; Pollard <i>v.</i> Kellerstrass, Judge Philips enjoined the whole
work because the infringing parts were not separable. In 1903, in Thompson
Co. <i>v.</i> American Law Book Co., where the editor of the defendant's
law encyclopædia had made a list of cases cited in complainant's work,
which included material "pirated" by the complainant from copyright works,
the Circuit Court of Appeals, reversing the lower court, held through
Judge Coxe that there was no infringement, because the only use made of
the list was to guide the defendant to the reports and because the
complainant had no standing in equity. "If the defendant was guilty of
piracy, so was the complainant; and equity will not protect a pirate from
infringements of his piratical work." To like effect in Slingsby <i>v.</i>
Bradford Co., in 1905, Justice Warrington, in the Chancery Division, held
that the plaintiff could not recover against an evident copying because
his own catalogue was fraudulent in advertising as patented articles not
so protected, and a fraud will not be protected. In <a name="Page_259"
id="Page_259"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 259]</span>the later case of
West Pub. Co. <i>v</i>. Thompson Co., where the publishers of the original
reports and digests sought to restrain the Thompson encyclopædias, the
Circuit Court of Appeals held that while a compiler may use a copyright
digest by making lists from which to run down cases, which is "fair use,"
extensive copying or paraphrasing of the language of the digest, whether
to save literary work or mechanical labor, constitutes an infringement.
The case was sent back to the lower court for rehearing and assessment of
damages and was settled in 1911 by an agreement involving transfer of the
encyclopædia to the plaintiff. Reference to a copyright work giving
pagination is not an infringement, as was decided in 1909, in Banks Law
Pub. Co. <i>v.</i> Lawyers Co-operative Pub. Co., in the U.&nbsp;S.
Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="259a"></a>Quotation</p>

<p>Whether simple quotation constitutes an infringement or is "fair use,"
depends upon extent and in some respects upon purpose. In 1892 Justice
North, in the English Court of Chancery, in Walter <i>v.</i> Steinkopff,
held that the use by the <i>St. James Gazette</i> of two fifths of an
article by Kipling, copyrighted by the <i>Times</i>, was beyond "fair use"
of quotations, notwithstanding the newspaper custom of copying from one
another. On the other hand, quotations in a review of a book made to
reasonable extent for the purposes of criticism, have usually been
considered "fair use," provided they do not go to the extent of a
description or abridgment which would be measurably a substitute for the
book.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="259b"></a>Private use</p>

<p>The multiplication of copies by handwriting or other process for
private use, as among the members of an orchestra or in a business office,
has been held an infringement in English decisions, though prohibition of
the making of a single copy for personal use would be an extreme
application of this doctrine, <a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 260]</span>and such use is specifically permitted in
the new English code.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="260a"></a>The doctrine of "unfair
competition"</p>

<p>Beyond the purview of copyright law, there is a means of legal remedy
for the copyright proprietor which can be enforced by state as well as by
federal courts, resting either upon statutes outside the copyright law, or
on the general principles of equity. This is the application of the
doctrine of "unfair competition" especially in cases involving "fraud" or
fraudulent representation, direct or implied, leading the purchaser to buy
something other than what he supposes he is buying. Thus if a publisher
prints and binds a book with a title and in a style that leads a purchaser
to suppose that it is another book which he is buying, the publisher of
the other book has the right to obtain equitable relief by an injunction
from the transgressor on the ground of unfair competition without any
reference to copyright law, although this doctrine is more applied in the
case of patents, trade-marks and copyrights than perhaps any other
field.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="260b"></a>The doctrine of deceptive
intent</p>

<p>There is also evident a growing tendency on the part of the courts to
protect the public from possible deception especially if done with
fraudulent intent, where some distinctive name or symbol or form
associated with some line of product is used for another line of product
of different origin and character, though there may be here no direct
competition; but this comparatively new doctrine is more likely to be used
in regard to trade-mark articles than in respect to literary and like
property. It might, however, apply in a case where a well-known publishing
house had published, for instance, a popular series of school books as
Smith's Arithmetical Readers and another firm containing the same name had
started to publish a Smith's Algebraic Readers&mdash;but the application
would be extremely doubtful. </p>

<p class="sidenote"> <a name="261a"></a>The "Chatterbox" cases</p>

<p><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
261]</span>In the Chatterbox cases, 1884-1887, previously referred to, the
final decision of Judge Shipman emphasized the view that the use of the
title "Chatterbox" on a similar publication was misleading to the public,
thus bringing both trade-mark law and common law protection to the rescue
against unfair competition.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="261b"></a>Encyclopædia Britannica cases</p>

<p>In the series of Encyclopædia Britannica cases, 1890-1904, the English
publishers Black or their American representatives Scribner sought to
protect in this country the English edition, or an American authorized
edition, under the copyright law previous to 1891, copyrighted articles by
Americans being included, and under common law because of the alleged
fraudulent misuse of the name to mislead the public. In 1893, in Black
<i>v.</i> Allen, Judge Townsend held that the use of copyrighted material
in a non-copyright work did not vitiate the copyright, that the American
author was entitled to secure and protect copyright even though the right
to use was assigned to an English house which could not directly secure
copyright, and that the fact of discrepancy in the title of the
copyrighted articles as registered for copyright on separate publication
and deposit and in the cyclopædia, did not endanger the copyright. In
1904, in Encyclopædia Britannica Co. <i>v.</i> Tribune Association, Judge
Lacombe in the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court enjoined condensations of the
copyrighted American articles. But in Black <i>v.</i> Ehrich and other
cases, the complainants were not successful in obtaining an injunction
against the use of the title Encyclopædia Britannica on reprints of
non-copyright material which did not mislead the public.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="261c"></a>Webster Dictionary cases</p>

<p>In the Webster Dictionary cases in 1890-1909, a long litigation between
the Merriams, as authorized publishers of Webster, and Ogilvie and other
defendants, the courts held that the use of the name Webster <a
name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 262]</span>or
the title Webster's Dictionary could not be restrained when used in
connection with a reprint of the original Webster Dictionary, then out of
copyright, or otherwise in a manner not likely to mislead the public; but
injunctions were granted and sustained against the use of these names on
dictionaries issued in form so like the Merriam editions as to deceive the
public, or in connection with misleading advertisements or circulars.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="262a"></a>"Old sleuth" cases</p>

<p>In 1888-1890 George Munro, publisher of the "Old sleuth" detective
series, sought in actions against several defendants to protect the use of
the name "Sleuth" and was upheld in the N. Y. Supreme Court in separate
decisions by Judges Andrews, O'Brien, and Patterson, while in one of the
cases Judge Ingraham held that "sleuth" was a dictionary word and could
not be protected; in 1889 the N. Y. Court of Appeals through Chief Judge
Parker decided that the name "Sleuth" was protectable, and in 1890 Judge
Macomber of the N. Y. Supreme Court held that "Sleuth" was properly a
subject of trade-mark. But in 1890 also, Judge Shipman in the U.&nbsp;S.
District Court dismissed the complaint in another Munro case, as to an
illustration picturing "Old Sleuth," on the ground that though of the same
subject it was not of the same character. These cases illustrate the
difficulty of decisions in this borderland of equity.</p>

<p>In 1894 Judge Green, in the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court in New Jersey, in
Social Register Association <i>v.</i> Howard, protected on grounds of
equity the title "Social register" as descriptive of a social directory
covering Orange, N. J., and enjoined the use of "Howard's Social register"
as unfair competition. In 1887 the Harper house, as publishers of the
<i>Franklin Square Library</i>, obtained from the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit
Court, through Judge Waite, an injunction against the <a name="Page_263"

Library Company for violation of their trade-mark rights in the name.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="263a"></a>Rebound copies</p>

<p>Where the American Book Co. brought suit against Doan &amp; Hanson, who
had restored and rebound used copies of school books, the U.&nbsp;S.
Circuit Court of Appeals held in 1901 that there was no violation of law,
but required notice that the books were second-hand copies by conspicuous
stamp on the cover. In 1891 the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, in Dodd
<i>v.</i> Smith, declined to grant Dodd, Mead &amp; Co. an injunction
against rebinders who had purchased from them sheets of a fifty-cent
paper-covered edition of a novel by E. P. Roe and bound these in cloth to
sell at sixty cents in competition with the plaintiff's $1.50 cloth
edition.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="263b"></a>The Kipling case</p>

<p>In 1899 G. P. Putnam's Sons purchased from Kipling's authorized
publishers sheets of twelve volumes, added three volumes of non-copyright
or otherwise authorized material and published the fifteen volumes,
"Brushwood edition," of Kipling's works, with the design of an elephant's
head on the binding. Kipling sought an injunction for infringement of
copyright, use of trade-mark and unfair competition with the "Outward
bound edition" of his works, which also bore an elephant's head. In 1903
the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court of Appeals, through Judge Coxe, affirmed a
decision holding as "a well-recognized principle of law" that "the
defendants, having purchased unbound copyrighted volumes, were at liberty,
so far as the copyright statute is concerned, to bind and resell them";
that the elephant's head, not being a registered trade-mark, could not be
protected as a trade-mark; and that there was no similarity of editions
constituting unfair competition. But in 1907, in Dutton <i>v.</i> Cupples
&amp; Leon, the plaintiffs obtained damages for a series of books closely
imitating the <a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 264]</span>get-up of their "Gem" or "Dainty" series.
Passing off, however, cannot be made ground of action when material
protectable by copyright has not been copyrighted, as was held in 1908, in
Bamforth <i>v.</i> Douglas Post Card Co., by Judge McPherson in the
U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court.</p>

1903 as involving no deception.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="264b"></a>The Drummond case</p>

<p>In 1894 Henry Drummond, a British subject, obtained from Judge Dallas,
in the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court, an injunction restraining Henry Altemus
from publishing what purported to be exact reports of twelve lectures, of
which eight only had been imperfectly reported in the <i>British
Weekly</i>, on the ground that the author had a common law right to
restrain the publication "of any literary matter as the plaintiff's, which
was not actually his creation, and to prevent fraud."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="264c"></a>The new British code</p>

<p>The new British measure comprehensively defines infringement as the
doing without consent of the owner of the copyright of "anything the sole
right to do which is by this act conferred on the owner of the copyright,"
but specifically excepts (1) fair dealing for private study, research,
criticism, review or newspaper summary; (2) use by an artist of sketches,
etc., made for a work of which he has sold the copyright, provided he does
not repeat or imitate that work; (3) graphic reproduction of objects, or
photographing of paintings, etc., in a public place; (4) limited extracts
for use in school books; (5) report of lectures unless prohibited by
placard; (6) reading or recitation of reasonable extracts.</p>

<h4>REMEDIES AND PROCEDURE</h4>

<p class="p2 sidenote"><a name="265a"></a>Protection and procedure</p>

<p>It was for the protection of copyrights that the statute of Anne was
passed and that statutory law thus began to replace English common
law&mdash;a gain to authors sadly offset by its losses. But it was
undoubtedly true that without statutory provision the proprietor of
literary and similar property could not obtain the protection necessary
for the enforcement of his rights. The new American code is comprehensive,
detailed and specific in its legal provisions for protection and
procedure, and in respect to punishment far beyond any copyright
legislation on the statute books of any other nation.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="265b"></a>Injunction</p>

<p>The first protection given by the statute is the injunction usual in
equity proceedings, following the precedent of early legislation.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="265c"></a>Damages</p>

<p>Under previous American law, damages were levied primarily on
infringing copies found in possession of the infringer or his agents, with
the unfortunate result that when an infringer was successful in selling
his edition, few, if any, copies were found on which to levy damages. The
new code thoroughly corrects this defect by providing for specified
damages on infringing copies "made or sold by or found in the possession
of the infringer or his agents or employees." The plaintiff is entitled to
damages and all profits and is required only to prove sales, while the
defendant is required to prove the elements of cost. The
damages&mdash;assessed as such and not as penalties so as to free
copyright litigation from the restrictions of penal proceedings&mdash;are
stated as one <a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 266]</span>dollar for each infringing copy, except
copies of a painting, statue or sculpture on which they are ten dollars
per copy; fifty dollars for each infringing delivery of an oral work; one
hundred dollars for the first and fifty dollars for each subsequent
infringing performance of a dramatic, dramatico-musical, choral or
orchestral work; and ten dollars for each infringing performance of any
other musical work. These damages shall not be less than $250 or more than
$5000 in any one case, with the exception that for a newspaper
reproduction of a photograph the minimum shall be fifty dollars and the
maximum two hundred dollars, a concession insisted upon by newspaper
proprietors.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="266a"></a>One suit sufficing</p>

<p>Injunction, damages and profits, and delivery of infringing copies or
means of production, are covered in the single suit to protect the
copyright.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="266b"></a>Deposit of infringing articles</p>

<p>During the pendency of an action the defendant may be required to
deposit all articles alleged to infringe copyright, making oath that he
has deposited all such, under regulations for his protection prescribed,
as the law directs, by the Supreme Court, which regulations are given in
full in the appendix of this volume; and when such articles are adjudged
to be infringements, he must deliver up for destruction not only such
infringing copies or devices, but also all plates, molds, matrices or
other means for making such infringing copies as the court may order,
making oath that he has delivered up all such.</p>

<p>The text covering these provisions, with the exception of subsection
(e), referring to mechanical musical reproductions, given in the chapter
on that subject, is as follows:</p>

<p>"(Sec. 25.) That if any person shall infringe the copyright in any work
protected under the copyright laws of the United States such person shall
be liable: </p>

<p class="sidenote"> <a name="267"></a>Remedies specified</p>

<p>"(b) To pay to the copyright proprietor such damages as the copyright
proprietor may have suffered due to the infringement, as well as all the
profits which the infringer shall have made from such infringement, and in
proving profits the plaintiff shall be required to prove sales only and
the defendant shall be required to prove every element of cost which he
claims, or in lieu of actual damages and profits such damages as to the
court shall appear to be just, and in assessing such damages the court
may, in its discretion, allow the amounts as hereinafter stated, but in
the case of a newspaper reproduction of a copyrighted photograph such
damages shall not exceed the sum of two hundred dollars nor be less than
the sum of fifty dollars, and such damages shall in no other case exceed
the sum of five thousand dollars nor be less than the sum of two hundred
and fifty dollars, and shall not be regarded as a penalty:</p>

<p>"First. In the case of a painting, statue, or sculpture, ten dollars
for every infringing copy made or sold by or found in the possession of
the infringer or his agents or employees;</p>

<p>"Second. In the case of any work enumerated in section five of this
Act, except a painting, statue, or sculpture, one dollar for every
infringing copy made or sold by or found in the possession of the
infringer or his agents or employees;</p>

<p>"Third. In the case of a lecture, sermon, or address, fifty dollars for
every infringing delivery;</p>

<p>"Fourth. In the case of dramatic or dramatico-musical or a choral or
orchestral composition, one hundred dollars for the first and fifty
dollars for every subsequent infringing performance; in the case of <a
name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
268]</span>other musical compositions, ten dollars for every infringing
performance;</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="268a"></a>Impounding</p>

<p>"(c) To deliver up on oath, to be impounded during the pendency of the
action, upon such terms and conditions as the court may prescribe, all
articles alleged to infringe a copyright;</p>

<p>"(d) To deliver up on oath for destruction all the infringing copies or
devices, as well as all plates, molds, matrices, or other means for making
such infringing copies as the court may order;</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="268b"></a>Supreme Court rules</p>

<p>"Rules and regulations for practice and procedure under this section
shall be prescribed by the Supreme Court of the United States," for which
see appendix.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="268c"></a>Court jurisdiction</p>

<p>The Circuit Court, or District or other courts having circuit
jurisdiction, of the United States, have original jurisdiction "of all
suits at law or in equity arising under the patent or copyright laws of
the United States" with appeal or writ of error to the Supreme Court of
the United States. Copyright cases are brought in the first instance
before a single judge sitting in Circuit Court or District Court, and
thence are appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals consisting of three or
more circuit judges, and thence again to the United States Supreme Court,
the final authority. These federal courts have sole jurisdiction under the
copyright law as such; but copyright cases are often adjudicated in State
courts on questions arising under the law of contracts or other statute or
common law, regard being always given to the decisions of the federal
courts as to copyright questions proper which may be involved. In other
words, the State courts do not pass upon copyright law, but may apply,
within the respective states, the copyright decisions of federal courts.
Thus in Hoyt <i>v.</i> Bates, in 1897, Judge Putnam in the U.&nbsp;S.
Circuit Court in Massachusetts remanded the case back to the State <a
name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
269]</span>courts because the question was not under the copyright law as
such, but regarding the ownership of copyright property. In this case the
author of a play "A black sheep," containing a song "Sweet Daisy Stokes,"
licensed the defendant to print the song. The defendant copyrighted the
song and the plaintiff sued to compel him to assign his copyright. The
case illustrates the respective jurisdictions of federal and State courts
in copyright matters.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="269"></a>Limitation</p>

<p>The United States courts have authority to enter the decrees necessary
to enforce the remedies provided by the law. Important provisions of the
new code provide that civil action in copyright cases may be brought "in
the district of which the defendant or his agent is an inhabitant or in
which he may be found"&mdash;thus preventing avoidance by the defendant
possible under earlier law; and also that any injunction granted in any
one district may be operative throughout the United States&mdash;a
provision adopted into the law from recent legislation intended to prevent
the evasion of injunctions, particularly by "fly by night" dramatic
companies passing from one state or court jurisdiction into another, but
usefully applicable also throughout the whole range of copyright
infringements. Criminal proceedings under the copyright act may not be
brought after three years from the commission of the offense.</p>

<p>Under the former laws the District courts also had certain&mdash;or
uncertain&mdash;jurisdiction. The distinction between the District courts
and the Circuit courts of the United States, both of which are courts of
first instance, has been so complicated and uncertain as to be practically
impossible of statement&mdash;a situation which has led to a measure for
the abolition of the distinction and the provision of a single court in
each federal district having original jurisdiction in <a name="Page_270"
id="Page_270"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 270]</span>the first instance,
from which appeal will go to the Circuit Court of Appeals and thence to
the U.&nbsp;S. Supreme Court, or in certain cases direct to the Supreme
Court.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="270a"></a>Text of procedure provisions</p>

<p>The text of these provisions is as follows:</p>

<p>"(Sec. 26.) That any court given jurisdiction under section thirty-four
of this Act may proceed in any action, suit, or proceeding instituted for
violation of any provision hereof to enter a judgment or decree enforcing
the remedies herein provided.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="270b"></a>Proceedings united in one
action</p>

<p>"(Sec. 27.) That the proceedings for an injunction, damages, and
profits, and those for the seizure of infringing copies, plates, molds,
matrices, and so forth, aforementioned, may be united in one action."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="270c"></a>Jurisdiction in copyright cases</p>

<p>"(Sec. 34.) That all actions, suits, or proceedings arising under the
copyright laws of the United States shall be originally cognizable by the
circuit courts of the United States, the district court of any Territory,
the supreme court of the District of Columbia, the district courts of
Alaska, Hawaii, and Porto Rico, and the courts of first instance of the
Philippine Islands.</p>

<p>"(Sec. 35.) That civil actions, suits, or proceedings arising under
this Act may be instituted in the district of which the defendant or his
agent is an inhabitant, or in which he may be found.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="270d"></a>Injunction provisions</p>

<p>"(Sec. 36.) That any such court or judge thereof shall have power, upon
bill in equity filed by any party aggrieved, to grant injunctions to
prevent and restrain the violation of any right secured by said laws,
according to the course and principles of courts of equity, on such terms
as said court or judge may deem reasonable. Any injunction that may be
granted restraining and enjoining the doing of anything forbidden by this
Act may be served on the parties against whom such injunction may be
granted <a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
271]</span>anywhere in the United States, and shall be operative
throughout the United States and be enforceable by proceedings in contempt
or otherwise by any other court or judge possessing jurisdiction of the
defendants.</p>

<p>"(Sec. 37.) That the clerk of the court, or judge granting the
injunction, shall, when required so to do by the court hearing the
application to enforce said injunction, transmit without delay to said
court a certified copy of all the papers in said cause that are on file in
his office.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="271a"></a>Appeal</p>

<p>"(Sec. 38.) That the orders, judgments, or decrees of any court
mentioned in section thirty-four of this Act arising under the copyright
laws of the United States may be reviewed on appeal or writ of error in
the manner and to the extent now provided by law for the review of cases
determined in said courts, respectively.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="271b"></a>No criminal proceedings after three
years</p>

<p>"(Sec. 39.) That no criminal proceeding shall be maintained under the
provisions of this Act unless the same is commenced within three years
after the cause of action arose."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="271c"></a>Strict compliance requisite</p>

<p>The copyright statutes are construed strictly, by the letter of the
law, in respect to procedure as well as to other features. This is
especially the case in respect to forfeiture and penalties, as where, in
Falk <i>v.</i> Heffron, in 1893, 2400 copies of a copyright portrait of
Lillian Russell had been lithographed, twenty-one on a sheet. Judge
Wheeler in the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court in New York held with the jury
that only one dollar per sheet could be recovered as penalty, because the
law specified "sheets." In McDonald <i>v.</i> Hearst, in 1899, in the
U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court in California, Judge DeHaven held that the
proprietor of the San Francisco <i>Examiner</i> could not be held liable
for copyright penalties because an employer could not be held to penal <a
name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
272]</span>responsibility for the act of his agent. In a suit to obtain
damages based on forfeiture, in Wheeler <i>v.</i> Cobbey, in 1895, Judge
Shiras in the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court in Nebraska sustained a demurrer on
the ground that the damages asked for depended on forfeiture and could not
be obtained unless the actual forfeiture was had within the statutory
limit of two years. In Morrison <i>v</i>. Pettibone, in 1897, in the
U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court in Illinois, Judge Seaman held that certain
sheets, seized during the process of lithographing, when only one color
had been printed, were not exact copies and therefore could not be
forfeited. In Bennett <i>v.</i> Boston <i>Traveler</i> Co., in 1900, the
Circuit Court of Appeals, through Judge Colt, refused relief because the
plaintiff had alleged infringement of a cartoon published in the New York
<i>Herald</i>, which was not specifically copyrighted, instead of alleging
infringement of the copyrighted newspaper of which it was a part. An
extreme case was that of Child <i>v.</i> N. Y. <i>Times</i> Co., in 1901,
where the plaintiff had purchased infringing copies from the defendant, in
which case Judge Hazel in the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court in New York held
that as these were not literally "found in possession" of defendant, a
penalty could not be collected. Several of these cases illustrate escapes
from justice which will not be possible under the code of 1909, which uses
broader phraseology. In Walker <i>v.</i> Globe Newspaper Co., in 1908,
where no copies of a pirated map were found in possession of the
defendants, the U.&nbsp;S. Supreme Court held that outside of statutory
remedies no suit for damages could be maintained.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="272"></a>Damage not penalty</p>

<p>On the other hand, in the case of Brady <i>v.</i> Daly, which came
before the U.&nbsp;S. Supreme Court in 1899, the defendants, on a question
of jurisdiction, raised the issue that the old law provided for a penalty
and <a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
273]</span>not for damages, in denying which Justice Peckham held that:
"The statute in using the word 'damages' did not mean a forfeiture or
penalty, as it is difficult to prove the exact amount which the proprietor
of a play may suffer by reason of an infringement. It is probable that
Congress intended to provide a remedy so that the proprietor could recover
a certain amount of damages without proof of what his actual loss had
been. In the face of the difficulty of determining the amount of damages,
a minimum sum is provided in any case, with the possibility of recovering
a larger amount on proof of greater damage. The idea of punishment is not
so much suggested as the desire to provide for compensation to the
proprietor." This rule was applied by Judge Lacombe in Patterson <i>v</i>.
Ogilvie, in 1902.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="273"></a>Other procedure decisions</p>

<p>In the case of Falk <i>v.</i> Curtis Pub. Co., which came before the
U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court in Pennsylvania twice in 1900, some important
decisions or indications as to copyright procedure were given. The defense
that under the copyright act the words "any person" did not include a
corporation was overruled by Judge Dallas on the ground that the general
statute specifically construed the word "person" to extend to partnerships
and corporations. In this case an action to recover penalties and an
action to replevin copies in possession were started independently and
simultaneously, and the Circuit Court of Appeals through Judge Buffington
affirmed the decision that as the penalties under the old act were
restricted to copies "found in possession," the suit for penalties was
premature. In the later case of Rinehart <i>v.</i> Smith, also in the
Pennsylvania circuit, it was pointed out that an action for replevin was
not the proper form of suit because in such actions bonds might be given
and the forfeiture of copies thus be barred; and in Hegeman <i>v.</i> <a
name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
274]</span>Springer, the Circuit Court in New York held, in 1901, that a
replevin suit, involving prior demand, was not necessary and that the
copyright statute itself gave authority for an action for seizure without
previous demand, as would be necessary in replevin proceedings. It was
held, however, in the Illinois circuit in an earlier case, that a suit of
replevin will lie to enforce forfeiture under the copyright act. Several
of these perplexities, however, are removed by the code of 1909, which
expressly (sec. 27) authorizes the bringing together of all the remedies
in one action.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="274a"></a>Preventive action</p>

<p>That there can be no infringement of copyright by acts committed before
the copyright was obtained, was decided in 1900 in the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit
Court in the case of Maloney <i>v.</i> Foote, where the two parties were
jointly engaged in preparing directories, and the plaintiff obtained the
copyright and brought suit for infringement for the prior use of material,
the question being of contract and not of copyright. On the other hand, as
far as practicable, "it is the policy of the law to arrest the pirate
before he actually makes off with the plunder," said Judge Coxe in the
U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Gannet <i>v.</i> Rupert, in
1904.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="274b"></a>Party in suit</p>

<p>In 1903, in Champney <i>v.</i> Haag, it was held in the U.&nbsp;S.
Circuit Court in Pennsylvania, that though a copy of a photograph of a
copyright painting was an infringement, it was not the owner of the
original copyright but the owner of the photograph who must sue&mdash;but
this is contrary to the English ruling case of Lucas <i>v.</i> Williams,
and is probably not good law.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Suit for injury to reputation</p>

<p>A curious case arose in England in 1892 as to the rights of an author
after publication and transfer of copyright, in Lee <i>v.</i> Gibbings,
where the plaintiff had prepared for the defendant, a publisher, at an
agreed price, an edition with introduction of Lord Herbert's
autobiography, which the defendant reissued in a <a name="Page_275"
id="Page_275"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 275]</span>condensed edition
without the introduction and other matter by the author, though retaining
his name. The author sued to restrain the condensation as an injury to his
reputation, but Justice Kekewich in the Chancery Division held that this
should be a suit for libel and not under copyright, and declined to enjoin
the defendant before the question whether this was actually a libel was
settled.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="275a"></a>Damages in willful case</p>

<p>In a case of evident bad faith in wholesale copying, the U.&nbsp;S.
Circuit Court in Hartford Printing Co. <i>v.</i> Hartford Directory Co.
awarded as damages the gross receipts less estimated cost.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="275b"></a>Penal provisions</p>

<p>The provisions for collecting damages and profits are supplemented in
case of infringement, willfully and for profit, by penal provisions which
make the offense a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment not exceeding
one year or fine not less than $100 or more than $1000, or both, in the
discretion of the court, according to the following provision (sec.
28):</p>

<p class="sidenote">Penalty for willful infringement</p>

<p>"That any person who willfully and for profit shall infringe any
copyright secured by this Act, or who shall knowingly and willfully aid or
abet such infringement, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon
conviction thereof shall be punished by imprisonment for not exceeding one
year or by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars nor more than one
thousand dollars, or both, in the discretion of the court."</p>

<p>This provision (sec. 28) includes however a proviso exempting from
prevention or punishment the performance of certain musical works for
charitable or educational purposes and not for profit, which proviso is
given in full in the chapter on dramatic and musical copyright.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="276a"></a>Penalty for false notice of
copyright</p>

<p>Provision is also made in the new statute for the punishment by fine,
but not by imprisonment, of any <a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 276]</span>person who with fraudulent intent affixes a
copyright notice or its equivalent on an uncopyrighted work, or removes or
alters the copyright notice in a copyrighted work, the fine being not less
than $100 nor more than $1000; and of any person who shall knowingly
issue, sell or import any article bearing notice of United States
copyright which has not been copyrighted in this country, the fine in this
case being $100, according to these provisions:</p>

<p>"(Sec. 29.) That any person who, with fraudulent intent, shall insert
or impress any notice of copyright required by this Act, or words of the
same purport, in or upon any uncopyrighted article, or with fraudulent

United States copyright which has not been copyrighted in this country, or
who shall knowingly import any article bearing such notice or words of the
same purport, which has not been copyrighted in this country, shall be
liable to a fine of one hundred dollars."</p>

<p>Further provisions as to importation are given in the chapter on that
subject.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="276b"></a>Allowance of costs</p>

<p>In addition to injunction, damages and profits, delivery of copies,
etc., the courts may allow costs inclusive of attorney's fees as
provided:</p>

<p>"(Sec. 40.) That in all actions, suits, or proceedings under this Act,
except when brought by or against the United States or any officer
thereof, full costs shall be allowed, and the court may award to the
prevailing party a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs."</p>

<p>It seems impracticable and undesirable to attempt in this chapter a
statement of the procedure under <a name="Page_277"
id="Page_277"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 277]</span>former copyright
laws in this country, or under the legal methods in vogue in other
countries, for which the legal authorities on local procedure and practice
should be consulted.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="277"></a>The new British code</p>

<p>The new British measure provides the usual civil remedies of
injunction, damages, account and costs in the discretion of the court. The
author, or if no author the publisher whose name is indicated on the work,
is <i>prima facie</i> recognized as owner unless the contrary is proved.
Infringing copies or plates become the property of the copyright owner. If
the infringer proves ignorance, only an injunction will hold. In
architectural works, after construction has been commenced, damages and
not an injunction are provided for. Actions must be commenced within three
years. Summary conviction is provided for in the case of any person
knowingly and for profit or trade making, offering, distributing,
exhibiting or importing infringing copies or making or having in
possession infringing plates with penalty of a fine not exceeding fifty
pounds, or in case of a second offense, imprisonment not exceeding two
months, as also destruction or delivery up to owner of the copyright. The
summary provisions of the musical copyright acts of 1902 and 1906 remain
unrepealed.</p>

<p>Under previous law there had been two notable cases of criminal
punishment for conspiracy. In 1906, <i>Re</i> Willets against a
combination among cheap music publishers, where the Common Serjeant
sentenced the vendors to nine months' imprisonment, and in 1910, <i>Re</i>
Bokenham, where pirates who had conspired to print surreptitiously
obtained copies of Oscar Wilde's poem "De Profundis," were also sentenced
to six months and lesser periods.</p>

<h4>IMPORTATION OF COPYRIGHTED WORKS</h4>

<p class="p2 sidenote"><a name="278a"></a>Copyright and importation</p>

<p>The right to import a copyrighted book and, conversely, the right to
exclude importation are rights incident to the general "exclusive right"
of an author or copyright proprietor. This is recognized, in terms or
inferentially, in the copyright law of most countries; and the American
copyright code is exceptional and almost without precedent, save that of
the preceding American law of 1891, in specifically permitting the
importation of copyrighted books in stated cases, without the consent or
authority of the copyright proprietor.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="278b"></a>Fundamental right of exclusion</p>

<p>As Senator O. H. Platt in the copyright debate of 1891 said: "The
fundamental idea of a copyright is exclusive right to vend, and the
prohibition against importation from a foreign nation is necessary to the
enjoyment of that right. The privilege of controlling the market is indeed
essential." The copyright laws of foreign countries, and our own copyright
legislation previous to 1891, carefully safeguard this right. When an
author cannot assure to an American publisher the American market he
cannot get from that publisher the price he would otherwise secure. In the
"international copyright amendment" of 1891, Congress accompanied the
manufacturing clause, which prohibited the importation of foreign copies
even with the consent of the author, by a proviso permitting certain
importations even without the consent of the author&mdash;on the
hom&oelig;opathic principle of off-setting one restriction upon authors'
rights by another restriction upon authors' rights. </p>

<p class="sidenote"> <a name="279a"></a>General prohibitions<br />

<a name="279b"></a>Exceptions permitted</p>

<p><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
279]</span>In general the law prohibits absolutely the importation of
"piratical copies" or of works bearing a false notice of United States
copyright; it also prohibits, even though with consent of the author and
the copyright proprietor, the importation in the case of works subject to
the manufacturing clause, of any copies not manufactured in this
country&mdash;but this prohibition does not apply to books in raised
characters for use of the blind; to foreign-made periodicals containing
authorized copyright matter; to authorized copies of a work in a foreign
language of which only an English translation has been copyrighted here;
or to authorized copies published abroad when imported under specified
exceptional circumstances. These exceptions permit the importation of
authorized copies for individual use and not for sale, not more than one
copy at a time (excepting a foreign reprint of a book by an American
author); or by or for the United States; or by or for stated educational
institutions, including libraries, not more than one copy at one time; or
when parts of collections or libraries purchased and imported <i>en
bloc</i>, or of personal baggage. Books imported under these exceptions
cannot be adduced in defense of infringements, as the law specifically
provides, <i>e.g.</i>, as when such a book contains no proper United
States copyright notice. Copies unlawfully imported may be seized and
forfeited like other contraband importations under regulations of the
United States Treasury, but it is provided that importations through the
mails or otherwise may be returned to the country from which the
importation is made on petition to the Secretary of the Treasury when
there is no evidence of negligence or fraud. The Secretary of the Treasury
and the Postmaster-General are jointly required to make regulations
against unlawful importation through the mails.</p>

<p><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 280]</span>
These provisions, it may be noted, are a singular mixture, almost without
precedent, of acceptance and denial of the "exclusive right" of the author
or copyright proprietor.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="280a"></a>Text provisions</p>

<p>In respect to the importation of books in relation with copyright, the
provisions of the American code as to prohibition and limited permission
are specific and detailed, as follows:</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="280b"></a>Prohibition of piratical copies</p>

<p>"(Sec. 30.) That the importation into the United States of any article
bearing a false notice of copyright when there is no existing copyright
thereon in the United States, or of any piratical copies of any work
copyrighted in the United States, is prohibited.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="280c"></a>Permitted importations</p>

<p>"(Sec. 31.) That during the existence of the American copyright in any
book the importation into the United States of any piratical copies
thereof or of any copies thereof (although authorized by the author or
proprietor) which have not been produced in accordance with the
manufacturing provisions specified in section fifteen of this Act, or any
plates of the same not made from type set within the limits of the United
States, or any copies thereof produced by lithographic or photo-engraving
process not performed within the limits of the United States, in
accordance with the provisions of section fifteen of this Act, shall be,
and is hereby, prohibited: <i>Provided, however</i>, That, except as
regards piratical copies, such prohibition shall not apply:</p>

<p>"(a) To works in raised characters for the use of the blind;</p>

<p>"(b) To a foreign newspaper or magazine, although containing matter
copyrighted in the United States printed or reprinted by authority of the
copyright proprietor, unless such newspaper or magazine contains also
copyright matter printed or reprinted without such authorization;</p>

<p><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 281]</span>
"(c) To the authorized edition of a book in a foreign language or
languages of which only a translation into English has been copyrighted in
this country;</p>

<p>"(d) To any book published abroad with the authorization of the author
or copyright proprietor when imported under the circumstances stated in
one of the four subdivisions following, that is to say:</p>

<p>"First. When imported, not more than one copy at one time, for
individual use and not for sale; but such privilege of importation shall
not extend to a foreign reprint of a book by an American author
copyrighted in the United States;</p>

<p>"Second. When imported by the authority or for the use of the United
States;</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="281"></a>Library importations</p>

<p>"Third. When imported, for use and not for sale, not more than one copy
of any such book in any one invoice, in good faith, by or for any society
or institution incorporated for educational, literary, philosophical,
scientific, or religious purposes, or for the encouragement of the fine
arts, or for any college, academy, school, or seminary of learning, or for
any State, school, college, university, or free public library in the
United States;</p>

<p>"Fourth. When such books form parts of libraries or collections
purchased en bloc for the use of societies, institutions, or libraries
designated in the foregoing paragraph, or form parts of the libraries or
personal baggage belonging to persons or families arriving from foreign
countries and are not intended for sale: <i>Provided</i>, That copies
imported as above may not lawfully be used in any way to violate the
rights of the proprietor of the American copyright or annul or limit the
copyright protection secured by this Act, and such unlawful use shall be
deemed an infringement of copyright.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="282a"></a>Seizure<br />

<a name="282b"></a>Return of importations</p>

<p>"(Sec. 32.) That any and all articles prohibited <a name="Page_282"
id="Page_282"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 282]</span>importation by this
Act which are brought into the United States from any foreign country
(except in the mails) shall be seized and forfeited by like proceedings as
those provided by law for the seizure and condemnation of property
imported into the United States in violation of the customs revenue laws.
Such articles when forfeited shall be destroyed in such manner as the
Secretary of the Treasury or the court, as the case may be, shall direct:
<i>Provided, however</i>, That all copies of authorized editions of
copyright books imported in the mails or otherwise in violation of the
provisions of this Act may be exported and returned to the country of
export whenever it is shown to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the
Treasury, in a written application, that such importation does not involve
willful negligence or fraud.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="282c"></a>Rules against unlawful
importation</p>

<p>"(Sec. 33.) That the Secretary of the Treasury and the
Postmaster-General are hereby empowered and required to make and enforce
such joint rules and regulations as shall prevent the importation into the
United States in the mails of articles prohibited importation by this Act,
and may require notice to be given to the Treasury Department or Post
Office Department, as the case may be, by copyright proprietors or injured
parties, of the actual or contemplated importation of articles prohibited
importation by this Act, and which infringe the rights of such copyright
proprietors or injured parties."</p>

<p>Customs regulations as to importation of copyright articles and joint
customs and postal regulations as to such importation through the mails,
were issued under the law of 1909 under date of July 17, 1911, and are
given in the appendix. As the copyright law forbids importation of
copyright books not manufactured in this country, even with consent of the
copyright proprietor, the customs regulations provide <a name="Page_283"
id="Page_283"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 283]</span>that copies
imported with the copyright proprietor's assent shall be seized and
destroyed by the government, while copies imported without the copyright
proprietor's consent, being forfeited under the law to such proprietor,
must be held by the customs authorities pending suit for forfeiture by the
copyright owner or his abandonment of his right to such copies. Duties
collected on books thus unlawfully imported are not refunded.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="283a"></a>Supersedure of previous
provisions</p>

<p>In relation especially to questions of importation, and in general, it
is of first importance to note that the present code superseded by repeal,
from July 1, 1909, all conflicting provisions, which practically means
all previous copyright legislation, and that except as to infringement
cases actionable at that date, the present code is the only copyright
law.</p>

<p>The provision to this effect is (sec. 63): "That all laws or parts of
laws in conflict with the provisions of this Act are hereby repealed, but
nothing in this Act shall affect causes of action for infringement of
copyright heretofore committed now pending in courts of the United States,
or which may hereafter be instituted; but such causes shall be prosecuted
to a conclusion in the manner heretofore provided by law."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="283b"></a>Manufacturing clause affects
earlier copyrights</p>

<p>This principle as construed by the Treasury Department (Treas. dec. no.
30316) especially affects copies whose <i>status</i> has been changed by
the new form of the manufacturing proviso (sec. 15). A modification adds
the condition that books must be printed from plates made from type set
within the United States and printed and bound in this country. The
Treasury Department has held in the case of an American edition of the
"Key of Heaven" copyrighted under the law of 1891, by Benziger Brothers,
of which sheets were sent abroad for binding, that the edition as <a
name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
284]</span>bound abroad cannot be re-imported into the United States,
although the sheets were manufactured here under the provisions of the law
of 1891, previous to July 1, 1909. These books were accordingly denied
importation and had to be returned to the country whence they were
exported as bound. The opinion of Attorney-General Wickersham of November
17, 1909, on which the Treasury ruling was based, says:</p>

<p>"This language [of sec. 31] clearly embraces every American copyright
in a book, regardless of whether that copyright was obtained under the
copyright laws embodied in the Revised Statutes, or the act of 1891, or
the copyright act of 1909. If the statute were otherwise, it would have
produced the anomalous condition that books copyrighted prior to March 3,
1891, would not be prohibited from importation by any manufacturing
provision; that books copyrighted after March 3, 1891, and prior to July
1, 1909, the date upon which the act of March 4, 1909, became effective,
would be prohibited unless printed from type set in the United States or
from plates made from type set in the United States, while books
copyrighted after July 1, 1909, would be prohibited if not printed from
type set in the United States or from plates made from type set therein,
and the printing and <i>binding</i> both performed within the limits of
the United States."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="284"></a>Importation of foreign texts</p>

<p>Where a work in a foreign language is copyrighted in the United States,
it was held by the Secretary of the Treasury (Treas. dec. no. 22751) in
1901, on advice of the Attorney-General, under the act of 1891, in the
case of Rostand's "L'Aiglon," that the original French edition must be
denied importation under the prohibition feature of the manufacturing
clause; but, as under the new code of 1909, "the original text of a work
of foreign origin in a language <a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 285]</span>other than English," is excepted from the
manufacturing clause, it follows that such original text cannot be denied
importation on copyright grounds, though importation might be restrained
as a matter of equity by an assignee who had bought for the American
market the right to publish here. In the case, however, of Liddel and
Scott's Greek-English Lexicon, of which an American edition was
copyrighted previous to the law of 1891, on a question raised by the
American Book Co., the Secretary of the Treasury held in 1901 (Treas. dec.
no. 22781) that the English edition could not be denied importation, as
the law previous to 1891 did not contain the prohibition incident to the
manufacturing clause. The Attorney-General in this case considered that
while the clause against importation, being remedial, might affect prior
copyright, yet as it particularly applied to books "so copyrighted" as not
to be imported during the existence of "such copyright," it should be
inferred that only books copyrighted under that act should be denied
importation&mdash;the law in general being prospective in its effect.
These two earlier opinions were taken into consideration in the opinion in
1909 by Attorney-General Wickersham, who held that the language of the new
code did not warrant the same construction.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="285"></a>Printing within country</p>

<p>Under the law of 1891, the Secretary of the Treasury held in 1903
(Treas. dec. no. 24742) that books printed abroad from type set or plates
made within the United States could not be prohibited importation under
the manufacturing clause; but the clause has been so amended in the code
of 1909 that printing in this country from type set within the United
States or from plates made within the country from type thus set, is
required as a condition of copyright, and copyright does not hold if any
of these three conditions <a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 286]</span>be neglected. It follows that in the case
of books so copyrighted and manufactured, any other edition must be
prohibited importation.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="286a"></a>Innocent importation</p>

<p>An English decision holds that an importer is not innocent because he
does not know that an importation includes copyright matter; and the
wording of our law implies the same, though an American decision held that
a partner or employer is not chargeable with statute penalties for acts
done without his knowledge by a partner or agent.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="286b"></a>Books not claiming copyright</p>

<p>An indirect and significant effect of the manufacturing proviso, in the
nature of a "boomerang" to American industries, is to prevent the
copyrighting of works which might otherwise be partly manufactured in
America. Thus the American versions of the Book of Common Prayer and of
Church Hymnals no longer seek American copyright, because the thin paper
editions, as on "Oxford paper," are necessarily printed abroad and could
not be imported if there were copyright on other editions which might be
made in America. Baedeker's "United States," though dealing exclusively
with and chiefly sold in this country, is not copyrighted, being protected
rather by the cost of reproducing its German-made maps and text, and by
its repute as a guide book and characteristic form, which might under the
doctrine of "fair use" give its American publishers some common law
protection against imitators.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="286c"></a>Periodicals may be imported<br />

<a name="286d"></a>Composite books not admitted</p>

<p>The code of 1909 permits the importation of periodicals containing
copyright matter authorized by the copyright proprietor, though not
manufactured in the United States, but this permissive exception does not
extend to composite books; and under the law of 1891 the Treasury
Department held that in the case of a book of poems, some of which were
copyrighted in the United States, the book could not be imported <a
name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
287]</span>unless the parts containing copyrighted poems had been printed
from type set within the United States. Under this ruling, applied to the
present law, foreign-made copies of books containing American copyrighted
poems or other articles, must be denied importation, because these
copyrighted portions were not type-set, printed and bound in this country.
It is possible, however, that under the rule "<i>de minimis non curat
lex</i>," a court might not justify the prohibition of books incidentally
containing in small proportion poems, extracts or other negligible items
of American copyright. Thus if an English cyclopædia contained copyrighted
contributions by American authors, such cyclopædia would be denied
admission unless such contributions might be adjudged a negligible
proportion of the work.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="287"></a>Rebinding abroad</p>

<p>The prohibition of importation under the manufacturing proviso of
copyrighted books not bound in this country, has been construed by the
Attorney-General, in an opinion of March 1, 1910 (given in Treas. dec. no.
30414), to refer to original bindings and not to rebindings. "Manifestly a
book is produced within the meaning of section 31 when it is printed and
bound; and the binding required to be done in the United States is the
original binding, the one which enters into the original production of the
book. When the manufacture of the book is thus completed it is entitled to
all the protection offered by the copyright laws, and it may be exported
and thereafter imported at the pleasure of the owner. There is,
furthermore, nothing in the act to indicate any intention that a book may
be deprived of this protection or right of importation when it has once
been acquired. If it shall become necessary or proper that the book be
rebound it is not thereby made a new book, but remains the same book, the
one that <a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
288]</span>was printed and originally bound in the United States as
required by the statute."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="288a"></a>Importation of non-copyright
translation</p>

<p>A curious question as to the prohibition of importation arose in
connection with a Swedish translation of the "purity" books of the "Self
and sex" series, by Dr. Sylvanus Stall, of Philadelphia, author and
publisher of this series. The original works in this series are by an
American author written and printed in English and manufactured and
copyrighted in America; and there are translations into twenty or more
languages authorized by the author but not copyrighted in the United
States. The copyright proprietor made an importation of the Swedish
translation without question, but the second importation was stopped by
the customs authorities at Philadelphia on the ground that the Swedish
translation was a copy of the American copyrighted work and must therefore
be denied admission because not manufactured in America. On appeal, the
Treasury Department, June 23, 1910, overruled the local authorities and
admitted the translation made in Sweden, and bearing no copyright notice,
as a work "of foreign origin in a language other than English."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="288b"></a>Books dutiable</p>

<p>Copyright protection and tariff "protection" are often spoken of as
related with each other, chiefly because in this country the importation
of books for libraries is, to a limited extent, free from tariff duties as
well as from copyright restrictions. There is no real relation between
them, but the sections of the American tariff of 1910 dealing with books
and works of art may be cited for the convenience of importers:</p>

<p>"(416) Books of all kinds, bound or unbound, including blank books,
slate books and pamphlets, engravings, photographs, etchings, maps,
charts, music in books or sheets, and printed matter, all the foregoing <a
name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
289]</span>wholly or in chief value of paper, and not specially provided
for in this section, twenty-five per centum ad valorem; views of any
landscape, scene, building, place, or locality in the United States on
cardboard or paper, not thinner than eight one-thousandths of one inch, by
whatever process printed or produced, including those wholly or in part
produced by either lithographic or photogelatin process (except show
cards), occupying thirty-five square inches or less of surface per view,
bound or unbound, or in any other form, fifteen cents per pound and
twenty-five per centum ad valorem; thinner than eight one-thousandths of
one inch, two dollars per thousand: Provided, That the rate or rates of
duty provided in the tariff Act approved July twenty-fourth, eighteen
hundred and ninety-seven, shall remain in force until October first,
nineteen hundred and nine, on all views of any landscape, scene, building,
place, or locality, provided for in this paragraph, which shall have,
prior to July first, nineteen hundred and nine, been ordered or contracted
to be delivered to bona fide purchasers in the United States, and the
Secretary of the Treasury shall make proper regulations for the
enforcement of this provision."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="289"></a>Books on free list</p>

<p>The following are included in the "free list" and are therefore free
from any duties:</p>

<p>"(516) Books, engravings, photographs, etchings, bound or unbound, maps
and charts imported by authority or for the use of the United States or
for the use of the Library of Congress.</p>

<p>"(517) Books, maps, music, engravings, photographs, etchings, bound or
unbound, and charts, which shall have been printed more than twenty years
at the date of importation, and all hydrographic charts and publications
issued for their subscribers or exchanges by scientific and literary
associations or <a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 290]</span>academies, or publications of individuals
for gratuitous private circulation, and public documents issued by foreign
governments.</p>

<p>"(518) Books and pamphlets printed chiefly in languages other than
English; also books and music, in raised print, used exclusively by the
blind.</p>

<p>"(519) Books, maps, music, photographs, etchings, lithographic prints,
and charts, specially imported, not more than two copies in any one
invoice, in good faith, for the use and by order of any society or
institution incorporated or established solely for religious,
philosophical, educational, scientific, or literary purposes, or for the
encouragement of the fine arts, or the use and by order of any college,
academy, school, or seminary of learning in the United States, or any
state or public library, and not for sale, subject to such regulations as
the Secretary of the Treasury shall prescribe.</p>

<p>"(520) Books, libraries, usual and reasonable furniture, and similar
household effects of persons or families from foreign countries, all the
foregoing if actually used abroad by them not less than one year, and not
intended for any other person or persons, nor for sale."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="290"></a>Library free importation</p>

<p>The provisions as to importation for libraries are made unnecessarily
onerous by Treasury regulations intended to insure the identification of
the actual copies so imported. In practice such copies are usually
imported by library agents acting for the library and not only must these
agents make oaths and present evidence of authorization from the library
authorities, but the librarian must certify to the receipt of the
individual copy, before it can be technically cleared from the custom
house through which it is imported, and the importer relieved from further
liability. Blank forms for these purposes are <a name="Page_291"
id="Page_291"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 291]</span>prescribed and
provided by the Treasury Department.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="291a"></a>Copyrights and the free list</p>

<p>The question whether copyrighted works could be imported because they
were included under the free list of the tariff came before the Treasury
Department in 1901. With respect to copyrighted music, the
Attorney-General considered the two questions whether the copyright law
prohibits the importation of copyright music and whether the free list in
the tariff constitutes an exception to the copyright law. He held as to
the latter that the tariff is to prescribe certain duties on importations;
it is not designed to authorize importation. It simply provides when and
under what circumstances certain articles are exempt from duty.
Accordingly copyrighted musical compositions are not taken out of the
effect of the copyright law. The Secretary of the Treasury ruled (Treas.
dec. no. 23225), in accordance with this advice, that copyrighted music
was prohibited importation,&mdash;but this refers to importation without
consent of the copyright proprietor.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="291b"></a>The duty on books</p>

<p>Although not of copyright bearing, the significance in respect to
importations of books of the newly added phrase "wholly or in chief value
of paper" in the tariff act of 1909, which otherwise continued the 25 per
cent duty on books, may here be mentioned, as of importance to importers.
It was included in the Payne tariff, apparently at the instance of the
bookbinding interests, and was at first construed by the local customs
authorities at New York to make books bound in leather subject to the 40
per cent duty on leather, and books bound in silk subject to the 50 per
cent duty on silk, as the component parts of chief value. The Secretary of
the Treasury has, however, overruled this view and admitted books thus
bound under the 25 per cent duty on the ground that "the <a
name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
292]</span>limitation placed upon the paragraph by the addition of the
words not found in the previous law was intended to exclude from that
rate, books bound in such fancy or costly bindings as to be imported not
on account of their intrinsic literary merit or their value as books." The
Board of General Appraisers has since, however, rendered a decision
supporting the local appraisers.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="292"></a>British prohibition of
importation</p>

<p>In Great Britain the copyright act of 1842 (sec. 17) provided that any
printed books, copyright in the United Kingdom, imported "for sale or
hire" as reprinted out of the British dominions otherwise than by "the
proprietor of the copyright or some person authorized by him" should be
forfeited, seized and destroyed by any customs or excise officer, and the
Customs act of 1843, setting forth that "great abuse had prevailed with
respect to introduction for private use," prohibited importation for use
as well as for sale or hire. The international copyright act of 1844 (sec.
10) excepted importations from the country "in which such books were first
published," but this act did not in terms repeal the provisions of the
acts of 1842 and 1843, and in the leading case of Pitt Pitts <i>v.</i>
George, in 1896, the Court of Appeal, two judges to one, decided that this
exception was inconsistent with the previous acts and not good law. In
this case an English music publisher who had purchased British copyright
in Raff's "La Fileuse," sued to restrain the importation of the original
German edition. The lower court, relying on the statute of 1844, refused
relief, but the Court of Appeal granted an injunction, holding, through
Judge Lindley, that the complete exclusion given to the British proprietor
by the act of 1842 "is most in accordance with legal principles and good
sense." It was further held that where the copyright had been divided, the
words "the <a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
293]</span>proprietor of the copyright" indicate the owner of the English
rights, and that if he had to "submit to an unlimited importation of books
lawfully printed in any part of Germany itself," the British copyright
"would be absolutely worthless, and the beneficial object frustrated," and
protection by covenant with the original proprietor is by no means
adequate.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="293a"></a>Foreign reprints</p>

<p>The colonial copyright act of 1847, usually known as the foreign
reprints act, authorized suspension by the Crown of the prohibition of
importation of foreign reprints, in any colony enacting "reasonable
protection to British authors"&mdash;which protection, in the twenty
colonies in which the act was availed of, usually took the shape of a
stated duty to be paid as royalty to the British copyright proprietor. The
customs consolidation act of 1876 continued the general prohibition, on
condition of notice by the proprietor of the British copyright to the
Commissioners of Customs.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="293b"></a>Divided market</p>

<p>Thus the British copyright and customs law recognizes the subdivision
of copyright territory for the exclusive control of a market, and excludes
accordingly foreign reprints whether piratical copies or authorized
foreign editions like the Tauchnitz series, and the original foreign
edition as well. In theory, if not in practice, a Tauchnitz copy in the
pocket of a traveler is subject to seizure, and written authority from the
copyright proprietor is technically necessary for the importation of a
single copy, apparently without exception in favor of the British
Government or the libraries.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="293c"></a>The new British code</p>

<p>The new British measure continues these provisions as embodied in the
customs consolidation act of 1876 and the revenue act of 1889 and in the
text of the new act. Copyright is infringed by any person who "imports for
sale or hire any work ... which to his <a name="Page_294"
id="Page_294"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 294]</span>knowledge infringes
copyright." Importation is prohibited of copies made out of the United
Kingdom, which if made therein would infringe copyright and as to which
the owner of the copyright gives written notice to the Commissioners of
Customs in accordance with regulations by the Commissioners, which
regulations may apply to all works or to different classes. The Isle of
Man is specifically excepted from the United Kingdom in respect to this
section. But the section is made applicable with the necessary
modifications to any included British possession in respect to copies made
out of that possession. The text of the new measure, retaining the phrase
"for sale or hire" from the act of 1842 and reaffirming the customs act of
1876, which makes no such exception, continues an unfortunate ambiguity as
to the importation of copies for private use, but precedent and court
decisions favor the complete control of the market by the copyright
proprietor through the complete exclusion of foreign copies.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="294"></a>Canadian practice</p>

<p>Canada had, in an act of 1850, availed itself of the foreign reprints
act by imposing a duty "not exceeding 20 per cent" on foreign reprints of
English works, and under this act the Dominion later became "flooded" with
cheap American reprints, while the royalty to British authors, fixed at
12-1/2 percent, was so inadequately collected that only £1084 was paid in
the ten years ending 1876. Canada accordingly passed its copyright act of
1875, providing for the reprinting of English copyright works in Canada
under Canadian copyright and prohibiting importation of such works except
in the original edition from the United Kingdom, and this act, although
opposed as an invasion of the exclusive control of their works by British
authors, was accepted by the British Parliament in the Canada copyright
act of the same year, <a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 295]</span>with the proviso that Canadian reprints
should be prohibited importation into the United Kingdom except with
assent of the copyright proprietor. It has since provided in the Fisher
act of 1900 for the prohibition of importation of an original edition of
an English work licensed for reprint in Canada, except two copies for
libraries and one copy through demand on the Canadian licensee by an
individual for use and not for sale&mdash;a provision considered <i>ultra
vires</i> by English authorities.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="295a"></a>Australian provision</p>

<p>The Australian code of 1905 prohibits the importation of all pirated
books or artistic works in which copyright is subsisting in Australia,
"whether under this act or otherwise," and provides for the forfeiture of
such works, on condition of written notice by the owner of the copyright
to the Minister, directly or through the Commissioners of Customs of the
United Kingdom, of the existence of the copyright and of its term. These
provisions do not seem to make clear whether original editions of English
works, of which an Australian edition is copyrighted, are held to be
contraband.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="295b"></a>Foreign practice</p>

<p>The legislation of France and Germany and other countries seems to
provide against importation inferentially rather than specifically, Russia
and Peru being exceptional in their specific prohibitions. But the
treaties and conventions between the several countries are for the most
part specific on this point, as are those of France providing that "when
the author of a work of which the property rights are guaranteed by the
present treaty shall have assigned his right of publication or of
reproduction to a publisher in the territory of either of the high
contracting parties with the reservation that the copies or editions of
this work thus published or reproduced cannot be sold in the other
country, these copies or editions <a name="Page_296"
id="Page_296"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 296]</span>shall be considered
and treated, respectively, in that country as illicit reproductions"; and
the treaties of Germany are especially specific with respect to musical
compositions.</p>

<p>The authorities as to the prohibition of importation in other countries
are fully given in a statement from the Librarian of Congress made part of
the printed record of the third hearing before the Patents Committees at
Washington, March 26-28, 1908, which includes the text of the opinion in
Pitt Pitts <i>v</i>. George as the leading English case.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="296"></a>International practice</p>

<p>The Berne convention of 1886 provided (art. XII) that "every infringing
(<i>contrefait</i>) work may be seized on importation into those countries
of the Union where the original work has right to legal protection," which
was modified by the amendatory act of Paris, 1896, to read "may be seized
by the competent authorities of the countries of the Union." The Berlin
convention continues in article 16 the later phraseology, and adds, "in
these countries seizure may also be made of reproductions coming from a
country where the work is not protected or protection has ceased." All
three conventions include also the proviso that the seizure shall take
place conformably to the domestic legislation of each country. This
phraseology apparently leaves the prohibition of editions authorized for
other countries as an open question to be determined under the domestic
legislation or practice of each country. The Pan American convention of
Buenos Aires, 1910, provides (art. 14): "Every publication infringing a
copyright may be confiscated in the signatory countries in which the
original work had the right to be legally protected, without prejudice to
the indemnities or penalties which the counterfeiters may have incurred
according to the laws of the country in which the fraud may have been
committed."</p>

<h4>COPYRIGHT OFFICE: METHODS AND PRACTICE</h4>

<p class="p2 sidenote"><a name="297a"></a>History of Copyright Office</p>

<p>Under the early American copyright laws, copyright entries and deposits
were made in the clerk's office of the respective District courts and
there was no central copyright office. The deposit copies were not
properly cared for, but what remained were collected into the vaults of
the national Capitol when copyright administration was centralized in the
Library of Congress. Under the law of 1870, the Librarian of Congress was
made the copyright officer, and for many years Ainsworth R. Spofford,
occupying that position, personally recorded entries and did much of the
work. Before the close of his administration of the Library, and while it
was still housed in the Capitol, the copyright business required the
services of a staff including at the last twenty-four persons. By a
special act of 1897, the office of Register of Copyrights was created,
subject to the authority of the Librarian of Congress, who remains the
ultimate administrative authority. The code of 1909 provided also for an
assistant register of copyrights. The Copyright Office now occupies the
southern end of the ground floor in the new Library building and the staff
has increased to eighty-four persons.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="297b"></a>Routine of registration</p>

<p>When a book is deposited for registration, accompanied by the claim for
copyright, preferably on the application form gratuitously provided by the
Copyright Office, its class designation, with its accession or sequence
number in that class, is at once stamped upon the deposit copy or copies,
with the date of receipt, and also upon a green record slip on <a
name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
298]</span>which all details in the progress of the work through the
Copyright Office are recorded with exact time of each act and the initials
of the respective clerks. This record, when completed, shows, besides the
class number and the title of the work, the date and hour of the receipt
of deposit copies and of the receipt of application, affidavit and fee,
with memorandum of the disposition of the fee if out of the ordinary
course; the examination of the application and affidavit, the preparation
of the white card for printer's copy, and the clearance of the work. Thus
cleared, the book is ready for examination by the Library Commission, the
delivery of one copy to the Catalogue Division of the Library of Congress,
the making of the certificate and its record and the making of the index
cards, all of which acts are performed usually on the day of receipt, or
otherwise as early as practicable on the following day. The record slip
also provides for noting and notifying claimants of defects as to the
deposit copies or the application for copyright, and for noting also the
reference to other departments, and the disposition of second deposit
copies.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="298"></a>Treatment of deposits</p>

<p>The deposit copies, as entered on day of receipt and stamped with date,
group and accession number, are placed on a table for inspection by what
is known as the Library Commission of the Library of Congress, consisting
of the Assistant Librarian, the Superintendent of the Reading Room and the
Chief of the Catalogue Division, who decide which books are desired for
the Library of Congress, and whether one or two copies thereof are
required; one copy not so required is retained as part of the records of
the Copyright Office. Accumulations of the past years and current
accessions were until recently stored in the sub-basement of the Library
of Congress building, but a new stack now furnishes abundant and
well-lighted <a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 299]</span>space for deposit copies and gradually all
deposit articles will be removed to this stack. The new provision for the
destruction of useless material happily prevents the continuing storage of
such material to an indefinite future.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="299a"></a>Destruction of useless material</p>

<p>The Librarian of Congress and the Register of Copyrights jointly are
authorized "at suitable intervals" to determine what articles received
during any period of years and remaining undisposed of, are useful for
permanent preservation, and in their discretion to provide for the
destruction of others, after a statement of the years of receipt of such
articles and notice to permit any lawful claimant to claim and remove them
has been printed in the catalogue of copyright entries from February to
November, permitting their reclamation within the month of December. There
is a special proviso that no manuscript of an unpublished work shall be
destroyed during the term of copyright without specific notice to the
copyright proprietor of record, permitting him to claim and remove it.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="299b"></a>Register of Copyrights</p>

<p>The Register of Copyrights, originally appointed by the Librarian of
Congress under the act of February 19, 1897, is made by the new code of
1909 a permanent administrative officer, appointed by and under the
direction and supervision of the Librarian of Congress at a salary of
$4000 per year and under bonds of $20,000. He is authorized under the law
to make rules and regulations for the registration of claims to copyright,
subject to the approval of the Librarian of Congress; is required to make
an annual report to the Librarian of Congress to be printed in the annual
report on the Library of Congress; to cover all fees into the Treasury and
report as to the same to the Secretary of the Treasury and to the
Librarian of Congress, and to provide and keep the necessary <a
name="Page_300" id="Page_300"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
300]</span>record books, indexes, etc. He is authorized to affix the seal
of the Copyright Office provided for by law, and is happily relieved by
the new code from the necessity of formal signature of certificates, etc.,
which under the old law wasted precious and difficult hours in small
routine work, the affixing of the seal being the sufficient and sensible
substitute for the personal signature. An assistant register of copyrights
at a salary of $3000 was provided for in the new act, also to be appointed
by the Librarian of Congress, with authority during the absence of the
Register to attach the seal and perform other necessary functions.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="300"></a>Catalogues and indexes</p>

<p>The law directs that the Register of Copyrights "shall print at
periodic intervals a catalogue of the titles of articles ... together with
suitable indexes, and at stated intervals ... complete and indexed
catalogues for each class of copyright entries, "which shall be admitted
in any court as <i>prima facie</i> evidence," shall be promptly
distributed to collectors of customs and postmasters of all exchange
offices and shall be furnished to others at a price not exceeding $5 per
annum for the complete catalogue or $1 for the catalogues issued during
the year for any one class.</p>

<p>The practice of the Copyright Office is to make for each copyrighted
book an index card, in conformity with the printed catalogue card of the
Library of Congress, and to utilize the linotype slugs set for this
purpose, with some modification, as the basis for the "Catalogue of
copyright entries" for books. The catalogue for books proper, Part I,
Group 1, is printed weekly with an annual index, which, together with Part
I, Group 2, issued monthly with more condensed entries,&mdash;containing
the titles for all other material registered under the legal designation
"book," not found in Group 1,<i> i. e.</i>, local directories and other
annuals, <a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
301]</span>pamphlets, leaflets and literary contributions to periodicals,
as also dramatic compositions, lectures and maps, including also the
preliminary reports of court decisions,&mdash;may be subscribed for at a
price of $1 per year. Part II, appearing monthly, covers periodicals, with
an annual index, at fifty cents per year. Part III, appearing monthly,
covers music, with an annual index, at $1 per year. Part IV, appearing
monthly, covers works of art, reproductions of a work of art, drawings or
plastic works of a scientific character, photographs and prints and
pictorial illustrations, with an annual index, at fifty cents per year.
The subscription price for the entire catalogue is $3 per year.
Subscriptions should be sent direct to the Superintendent of Documents,
Washington, D. C., with money orders or drafts in his name (stamps and
uncertified checks not accepted), and should not be sent to the Librarian
of Congress or to the Copyright Office.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="301"></a>Entry cards</p>

<p>The Library of Congress prints for all such books as are selected from
the copyright deposits for use in the Library, on the decision of the
Commission appointed by the Librarian, a catalogue card which forms part
of the library card catalogue system, and which can be had by public
libraries and by private purchasers at the price of two cents a card. This
card is used for the catalogues of the Library of Congress and for the
catalogues of depository libraries throughout the country, but is not
furnished in exchange by the Smithsonian Institution to foreign
institutions. The catalogue cards for "books" in Group 2, representing
considerably more than twice as many registrations as Group I, as well as
the index cards for all articles comprised in the remaining classes of
copyright deposits, are prepared in the Copyright Office, and are not
furnished to other libraries or to the public. </p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="308a"></a>Present organization</p>

<p>The organization of the Copyright Office under the <a name="Page_308"
id="Page_308"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 308]</span>present
administration of the Librarian of Congress, Herbert Putnam, appointed by
President McKinley in 1898, and the Register of Copyrights, Thorvald
Solberg, the first and only occupant of that post, appointed by the
Librarian of Congress in 1897, presents a standard of efficiency, celerity
and economy which is a model for governmental departments, or indeed for
any administrative business. The enormous amount of detail is systematized
and controlled by a remarkable method of record, and blank forms provide
in the utmost variety of detail for every feature of the work of
correspondence, especially in calling the attention of applicants to
defects in their applications, which are many and various.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="308b"></a>Efficiency of methods</p>

<p>As the result of this organization, the complex law of March 4, 1909,
was put in operation July 1, 1909, without a hitch; and inquiries made to
the Copyright Office are answered, usually on the same day, with
remarkable dispatch and accuracy. For instance, the many letters directed
mistakenly to the Register of Copyrights, instead of to the Commissioner
of Patents, the frequent applications for the protection of prints
designed for articles of manufacture, and the multitudinous applications
on articles not subject to copyright, or for projected works or for book
manuscripts previous to publication, are each covered by a form letter
with an index card of a distinctive color for each, so that a full record
is kept in the Copyright Office of such errors without unduly complicating
the copyright records proper. The Copyright Office now handles
approximately half a million items of entries, deposits and correspondence
during the year, and covers into the Treasury more than $100,000,
returning to the government a substantial sum above the direct cost of
administration.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="309a"></a>Registration 1909-1910</p>

<p>The Copyright Office prints annually a summary of <a name="Page_309"
id="Page_309"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 309]</span>its work, from
which it appears that in the year ending June 30, 1910, the first year of
operation of the new copyright code, it had issued copyright certificates
to the number of 96,634, representing an equal number of registrations at
$1 each. In addition thereto 11,433 registrations were made for
photographs at fifty cents each, for which no certificates were issued.
This annual summary for the fiscal year ending June 30 is printed as a
part of the annual report, for presentation to Congress each December; and
a summary for the calendar year is printed in separate form at the
beginning of the new year.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="309b"></a>Certificates for court use</p>

<p>In addition to the regular certificates in card form, the Copyright
Office also issues certificates in quarto shape when desired, which are
especially utilized in court proceedings as parts of the record.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="309c"></a>Searches</p>

<p>The Copyright Office makes searches for information, under the
provisions of the new law, at the rate of fifty cents for each full hour
of the person employed in such search.</p>

<p>The new Rules provide for such searches as follows:</p>

<p>"(49.) Upon application to the Register of Copyrights, search of the
records, indexes, or deposits will be made for such information as they
may contain relative to copyright claims. Persons desiring searches to be
made should state clearly the nature of the work, its title, the name of
the claimant of copyright and probable date of entry; in the case of an
assignment, the name of the assignor or assignee or both, and the name of
the copyright claimant and the title of the music referred to in case of
notice of user."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="309d"></a>Patent Office registry for
labels</p>

<p>Question having been raised by the Commissioner of Patents whether the
act of 1909 did not charge the Copyright Office with the registration as
"prints" of labels, etc., the Attorney-General, in an opinion of December
22, 1909, held that the copyright act of <a name="Page_310"
id="Page_310"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 310]</span>1909 did not
relieve the Patent Office of this duty, and it is still required to
register all prints which have heretofore been registered therein under
the act of June 18, 1874, and in the same manner as they have heretofore
been registered.</p>

<p>Many of the features of the Copyright Office, such as the forms for
applications, certificates, etc., have been treated in detail in the
chapter on formalities, which should be read in connection with this
chapter.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="310"></a>Foreign practice</p>

<p>In Great Britain there is no official copyright office, but
registration has been made at Stationers' Hall in charge of the
Stationers' Company, a <i>quasi</i> public institution, while deposit is
made primarily in the national library at the British Museum. The records
at Stationers' Hall and the printed or other catalogues of the British
Museum are public. But there is no printed copyright list except of
prohibitions of importations issued by the Commissioners of Customs. Under
the new British measure there is no registration at Stationers' Hall or
elsewhere.</p>

<p>In France there is no copyright office proper and the deposit copies
required from the printer are deposited with the Ministry of the Interior
at Paris or at the Prefecture or town clerk's office in the provinces. In
other European countries, the registration, when required, is made for the
most part in one of the government departments, as Ministry of Interior,
Department of Agriculture, etc. In Italy, as in several Spanish-American
countries, the registry is provincial instead of central, though in some
of these countries provision is made for report from time to time to a
central government office. In few countries is there a copyright office
proper, distinctively organized and named, except in certain English
colonies, as Australia and Canada, which have now a copyright office and a
Registrar of Copyrights.</p>

<h4>INTERNATIONAL COPYRIGHT CONVENTIONS AND ARRANGEMENTS</h4>

<p class="p2 sidenote"><a name="311a"></a>International protection of
property</p>

<p>With the growth of civilization, the practice of protecting in all
countries the property of the citizen of any other country has also grown,
until it is now a generally recognized principle. This principle, applied
to literary property, has resulted in international copyright among most
civilized nations.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="311b"></a>Early copyright protection</p>

<p>The first provision for international copyright, aside from the ancient
practice in France of giving protection to authors of other countries who
published their works therein, was made by Prussia in 1837, in a law which
provided that any country might secure copyright for its authors in
Prussia to the extent of reciprocal privileges granted by that
country.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="311c"></a>Early English protection</p>

<p>England followed, in 1838, with an "act for securing to authors, in
certain cases, the benefit of international copyright," which empowered
the Queen, by an Order in Council, to direct that the author of a book
first published in a foreign country should have copyright in the United
Kingdom, on certain conditions, providing that country conferred similar
privileges on English authors. The act of 1844 extended this privilege to
prints, sculpture and other works of art, and provided for international
playright. It expressly denied the privilege, however, to translations of
foreign works, and it was not until 1852 that provision was fully made for
translations of books and of dramatic compositions, the latter with the
proviso that "fair imitations or adaptations" of foreign plays or music
might be made. In this early period Great <a name="Page_312"
id="Page_312"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 312]</span>Britain negotiated
treaties with the German states (1846-55), France (1851), Belgium (1854),
Spain (1857), and Sardinia (1860), afterward extended throughout Italy.
The treaties generally included a proviso that duties on books, etc.,
imported into the treaty country, should not be above a stated sum, and in
the case of France there was to be no duty either way. The domestic
copyright acts had also provided, on the condition of first publication in
the United Kingdom, a practical measure of international copyright. The
international copyright act of 1875 repealed the exception as to plays,
and authorized the protection of foreign plays against imitation and
adaptation. Under these international copyright acts, registration at
Stationers' Hall, at a fee of one shilling only, was made a condition of
the copyright of foreign works, and the deposit of a copy of the first
edition and of every subsequent edition containing additions or
alterations at Stationers' Hall, for transmission to the British Museum,
was required, besides other local formalities, particularly in connection
with the limited protection of translations, which was for five years
only.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Adhesion to Berne convention</p>

<p>Great Britain became a signatory power of the Berne convention of 1886,
and the international copyright act of 1886, amending and in part
repealing the previous international copyright acts, was passed to enable
Her Majesty through Orders in Council to become a party to this
convention, which was ratified in 1887. This was made effective with
respect to the eight other countries which were parties to the original
Berne convention by the Order in Council of November 28, 1887, taking
effect December 6, 1887. The provisions of 1886 made registration and
deposit unnecessary for foreign works which had complied with the
formalities requisite in the country of origin, <a name="Page_313"
id="Page_313"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 313]</span>but it was
nevertheless held in Fishburn <i>v.</i> Hollingshead, in 1891, by Justice
Stirling, that a foreign work must comply with the provisions of the
copyright acts applicable, as to registration and delivery, to works first
produced in the United Kingdom, since a foreign work was entitled only to
the protection afforded to natives. In Hanfstaengl <i>v.</i> Holloway, in
1893, Justice Charles took the opposite view, and he was supported by the
Court of Appeal in Hanfstaengl <i>v.</i> American Tobacco Company, in
1894, which decided finally that the acts of 1842 and 1844 were repealed
as to foreign works and that registration and deposit of a foreign work
were unnecessary. The decision of the Court of Appeal in 1908, in Sarpy
<i>v.</i> Holland, that notice of reservation may be in foreign languages,
confirmed the provisions that no formalities beyond those in the country
of origin were requisite.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="313"></a>Effect of Berne convention</p>

<p>With the development of the International Copyright Union, through the
Berne convention of 1886, copyright relations between the leading
countries became more largely and truly international, and most of the
existing treaties of the unionist countries were superseded by the
international convention proper. In accordance, however, with the terms of
the convention, treaties broader than the provisions of the convention
might still remain in force or be later negotiated between one country and
another, and such conventions, on the "most favored nation" basis or
otherwise, have in fact been negotiated, especially by Germany, within the
present century. The arrangement for protection of foreign works in
unionist and other countries, under special treaties, will be found in
succeeding chapters on copyright in foreign countries, where treaties
broader than the international convention or made since 1900 are also
scheduled. The main features of international <a name="Page_314"
id="Page_314"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 314]</span>copyright
arrangements are tabulated in condensed form in the conspectus of
copyright by countries given in the preliminary pages.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="314a"></a>International literary
congresses</p>

<p>At the time of the Universal Exposition in Paris in 1878, the French
<i>Société des Gens de Lettres</i> issued invitations for an International
Literary Congress, which was held in Paris, under the presidency of Victor
Hugo, commencing June 4, 1878. From this came the <i>Association
Littéraire et Artistique Internationale</i>, which held subsequent
congresses at London in 1879, at Lisbon in 1880, at Vienna in 1881, at
Rome in 1882, at Amsterdam in 1883, at Brussels in 1884, and at Antwerp in
1885, at which the extension of international copyright was discussed and
advocated.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="314b"></a>Fundamental proposition</p>

<p>The Congress at Antwerp, in 1885, ratified the following proposition:
"The author's right in his work constitutes an inherent right of property.
The law does not create, but merely regulates it."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="314c"></a>Preliminary official conference,
1883</p>

<p>Partly at the initiative of this association and at the invitation of
the Swiss government, a preliminary conference of official representatives
of the several nations was held at Berne in September, 1883, at which the
following draft, submitted by the International Literary and Artistic
Association, was substantially adopted as the basis for a general
convention on the part of civilized nations:</p>

<p>"1. The authors of literary or artistic works published, represented,
or executed in one of the contracting States, shall enjoy, upon the sole
condition of accomplishing the formalities required by the laws of that
State, the same rights for the protection of their works in the other
States of the Union, whatever the nationality of the authors may be, as
are enjoyed by natives of the States.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="315"></a>Propositions of 1883</p>

<p>"2. The term literary or artistic works comprises <a name="Page_315"
id="Page_315"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 315]</span>books, pamphlets,
and all other writings; dramatic and dramatico-musical works; musical
compositions, with or without words, and arrangements of music; drawings,
paintings, sculptures, engravings, lithographs, maps, plans, scientific
sketches, and generally all other literary, artistic, and scientific works
whatsoever, which may be published by any system of impression or
reproduction whatsoever.</p>

<p>"3. The rights of authors extend to manuscript or unpublished
works.</p>

<p>"4. The legal representatives and assignees of authors shall enjoy in
all respects the same rights as are awarded by this convention to authors
themselves.</p>

<p>"5. The subjects of one of the contracting States shall enjoy in all
the other States of the Union during the subsistence of their rights in
their original works the exclusive right of translation. This right
comprises the right of publication, representation, or execution.</p>

<p>"6. Authorized translations are protected in the same manner as
original works. When the translation is of a work which has become public
property, the translator cannot prevent the work from being translated by
others.</p>

<p>"7. In the case of the infringement of the above provisions, the courts
having jurisdiction will apply the laws enacted by their respective
legislatures, just as if the infringement had been committed to the
prejudice of a native. Adaptation shall be considered piracy, and treated
in the same manner.</p>

<p>"8. This convention applies to all works that have not yet become
public property in the country in which they were first published at the
time of coming into force of the convention.</p>

<p>"9. The States of the Union reserve to themselves the right of entering
into separate agreements among <a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 316]</span>themselves for the protection of literary
or artistic works, provided that such agreements are not contrary to any
of the provisions of the present convention.</p>

<p>"10. A Central International Office shall be established, at which
shall be deposited by the Governments of the States of the Union the laws,
decrees, and regulations affecting the rights of authors which have
already been or shall hereafter be promulgated in any of the said
Governments. This office shall collect the laws, etc., and publish a
periodical print in the French language, in which shall be contained all
the documents and information necessary to be made known to the parties
interested."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="316"></a>First official conference, 1884</p>

<p>This draft, as adopted, was submitted by the Swiss government to the
first formal international conference for the protection of the rights of
authors, held at Berne from September 8 to 19, 1884. At this conference
representatives from thirteen countries were present&mdash;Austria,
Belgium, Costa Rica, France, Germany, Great Britain, Haiti, Holland,
Italy, Salvador, Sweden and Norway, and Switzerland; and the result of
their deliberations was a new "draft convention for the creation of a
general union for the protection of the rights of authors," similar to the
Universal Postal Union, in the following form:</p>

<p>"1. Authors placing themselves within the jurisdiction of the
contracting countries will be afforded protection for their works, whether
in print or manuscript, and will have all the advantages of the laws of
the different nations embraced in the Union.</p>

<p>"2. These privileges will be dependent upon the carrying out of the
conditions and formalities prescribed by the legislation of the author's
native country, or of the country in which he chooses to first publish his
work, such country being, of course, one of those included in the
convention. </p>

<p><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 317]</span>
"3. These stipulations apply alike to editors and authors of literary
works, as well as to works of art published or created in any country of
the Union.</p>

<p>"4. Authors within the jurisdiction of the Union will enjoy in all the
countries the exclusive rights of translation of their works during a
period of ten years after publication in any one country of the Union of
an authorized translation.</p>

<p>"5. It is proposed that it shall be made legal to publish extracts from
works which have appeared in any country of the Union, provided that such
publications are adapted for teaching or have a scientific character. The
reciprocal publication of books composed of fragments of various authors
will also be permitted. It will be an indispensable condition, however,
that the source of such extracts shall at all times be acknowledged.</p>

<p>"6. On the other hand, it will be unlawful to publish, without special
permission of the holder of the copyright, any piece of music, in any
collection of music used in musical academies.</p>

<p>"7. The rights of protection accorded to musical works will prohibit
arrangements of music containing fragments from other composers, unless
the consent of such composer be first obtained."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="317"></a>Second official conference, 1885</p>

<p>A second international conference was held at Berne from September 7 to
18, 1885, for the further consideration of the project. This was
participated in by representatives from sixteen
countries,&mdash;Argentina, Belgium, Costa Rica, France, Germany, Great
Britain, Haiti, Honduras, Holland, Italy, Paraguay, Sweden and Norway,
Spain, Switzerland, and Tunis. The United States was also represented at
that conference by a "listening delegate," Boyd Winchester, then the
United States minister at Berne.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="318a"></a>Third official conference, 1886</p>

<p>The negotiations at Berne culminated at the third <a name="Page_318"
id="Page_318"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 318]</span>formal conference,
of September 6 to 9, 1886, by agreement on a convention constituting an
international copyright union, the <i>Union Internationale pour la
Protection des &OElig;uvres Littéraires et Artistiques</i>, which was
signed on September 9, by the plenipotentiaries of ten countries, Great
Britain, Germany, Belgium, Spain, France, Haiti, Italy, Switzerland, Tunis
and Liberia. At this conference the United States was represented only as
in 1885.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="318b"></a>Berne convention, 1886:</p>

<p>The convention included twenty-one articles besides an additional
article and final protocol, article I being as follows: "The contracting
States are constituted into an Union for the protection of the rights of
authors over their literary and artistic works."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="318c"></a>Authors and terms</p>

<p>It was provided (art. II) that authors of any one of the countries
shall enjoy in the other countries the same rights as natives, on
complying with the formalities prescribed in the country of origin, <i>i.
e.</i>, of first publication, or in case of simultaneous publication, in
the country having the shortest term of protection, for a period not
exceeding the term of protection granted in the country of origin. This
protection was extended (art. III) to the publishers within the Union of
works whose authors belong to a country outside the Union.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="318d"></a>"Literary and artistic works"
defined</p>

<p>The expression "literary and artistic works" was defined (art. IV) by
specification, including dramatic and musical works, but not mentioning
photographs or actual works of architecture. Translations were protected
(art. V) for ten years, which period should run for works published in
incomplete parts (<i>livraisons</i>) from the publication of the last
part, or in the case of volumes or serial collections (<i>cahiers</i>),
from that of each volume, and in all cases from the thirty-first of
December of the calendar year of publication. Authorized translations were
protected (art. VI) as <a name="Page_319" id="Page_319"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 319]</span>original works, but translators of works in
the public domain could not oppose other translations. Reproduction of
newspaper or periodical articles was permitted (art. VII) unless expressly
forbidden, but this prohibition could not apply to political discussions,
news matter or "current topics" (<i>faits divers</i>). Liberty of extract
from literary or artistic works otherwise was left (art. VIII) to domestic
legislation or specific treaties.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="319a"></a>Performing rights</p>

<p>Protection was specifically extended (art. IX) to the representation of
dramatic or dramatico-musical works or translations thereof, and, on
condition of express reservation, to musical works; and adaptations,
arrangements, and other unauthorized indirect appropriations were
specially included (art. X) among illicit reproductions subject to
determination by the courts of the respective countries.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="319b"></a>Other provisions</p>

<p>The author indicated on a work, or the publisher of an anonymous or
pseudonymous work, was given (art. XI) authority to institute proceedings,
but the tribunal might require certificate that the formalities in the
country of origin had been accomplished. Pirated (<i>contrefait</i>) works
might be seized (art. XII) on importation, according to domestic law. The
convention was not to derogate (art. XIII) from the right of each country
to domestic control by legislation or police. Existing works, not fallen
into the public domain in the country of origin (art. XIV), were
protected. The several countries reserved (art. XV) the right to make
separate and particular treaty arrangements. An international office was
established (art. XVI) under the name of "Office of the International
Union for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works," under the
authority of the Swiss Confederation, the expenses to be borne by the
signatory countries. Revision at future conferences was <a
name="Page_320" id="Page_320"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
320]</span>provided for (art. XVII) with stipulation that alterations
should not be binding except by unanimous consent. Accession of other
countries was permitted (art. XVIII) on notice to the Swiss Confederation,
and similar provision was made (art. XIX) for the accession of colonies.
Ratification within one year (art. XX) and operation within three months
thereafter (art. XXI) and withdrawal by one year's notice of denunciation
were provided for. The "additional article" provided that the convention
should not affect existing conventions between the states, conferring more
extended powers or containing other stipulations not contrary to the
convention.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="320a"></a>Final protocol</p>

<p>On the exchange of ratifications September 5, 1887, a final protocol
was agreed upon, extending article IV to cover photographs in those
countries whose domestic legislation or treaty arrangements permitted such
protection; extending article IX to choregraphic works in countries in
which they were covered by domestic legislation; explicitly excepting
mechanical music reproductions from protection; and specifically referring
to domestic or treaty arrangements, the protection afforded by article XIV
to existing works not fallen into the public domain. The final protocol
also provided for the organization of the international office under
regulation by the Swiss Confederation, for French as the official
language, for the allotment of expenses among the countries, and for other
administrative details.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="320b"></a>Ratification in 1887</p>

<p>The Berne convention, as signed in that city September 9, 1886, by the
representatives of ten nations, Great Britain, Germany, Belgium, Spain,
France, Haiti, Italy, Switzerland, Tunis and Liberia, was ratified in the
same city September 5, 1887, by exchange of ratifications on the part of
all these powers except Liberia, and became effective December 5, 1887.
The <a name="Page_321" id="Page_321"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
321]</span>French acceptance included Algiers and the other French
colonies, the Spanish acceptance all Spanish colonies, and the British
acceptance, India, Canada and Newfoundland, the South African and the
Australian colonies. To these powers were later added Luxemburg (1888),
Monaco (1889), Montenegro (1893), which however withdrew in 1900, Norway
(1896), Japan (1899), Denmark (1903), Sweden (1904), and Great Britain's
new colonies, the Transvaal and Orange Free State (1903), leaving three
nations of first rank outside the Union, <i>i. e.</i>, Austria-Hungary,
Russia, and the United States, aside from the South American countries
later associated in the Pan American Union.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="321a"></a>Paris conference, 1896</p>

<p>The revision of the Berne convention provided for in art. XVII, which
was to be made according to the final protocol at a conference at Paris to
be called by the French government within from four to six years, was not
actually undertaken until 1896. When the signatory powers met in
conference at Paris, April 15 to May 4, 1896, they adopted an "additional
act," of four articles, which besides making verbal amendments for
clarification, substantially modified articles II, III, V, VII, XII, XX,
of the Berne convention and the first and fourth numbers of the final
protocol; and issued also an "interpretative declaration" as to both the
Berne convention and the final protocol, the additional act and the
interpretative declaration being sometimes cited together as "the Paris
acts."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="321b"></a>Paris Additional Act</p>

<p>The Additional Act of Paris (art. I and II) included "posthumous works"
amongst protected works, replaced the privileges given to publishers by a
provision extending protection to authors not subjects of unionist
countries for works first published in one of those countries; extended
the protection of translations throughout the term of the original work,
but <a name="Page_322" id="Page_322"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
322]</span>with the proviso that the right for any language should expire
after ten years unless the author had provided for a translation into that
language; specifically included serial novels published in periodicals,
and required indication of the source of articles reproduced from
periodicals. The right to seize piratical works was given to the
"competent authorities" of each country without specific reference to
importation. Withdrawal by denunciation was made applicable only to the
country withdrawing, leaving the convention binding upon all others.</p>

<p>It further provided (art. III) that the several countries of the Union
might accede to these additional acts separately, as might other
countries, and for ratification within a year and enforcement within three
months thereafter.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="322a"></a>Paris Interpretative
Declaration</p>

<p>The Declaration, simultaneously adopted, interpreting the convention of
Berne and the Paris additional act, declared (1) that protection depends
solely on accomplishment in the country of origin of the conditions and
formalities prescribed therein; (2) that "published works"
(<i>&oelig;uvres publiées</i>) means works actually issued to the public
(<i>&oelig;uvres éditées</i>) in one of the Union
countries&mdash;"consequently, the representation of a dramatic or
dramatico-musical work, the performance of a musical work, the exhibition
of works of art, do not constitute publication"; and (3) that "the
transformation of a novel into a play, or of a play into a novel" comes
under the protection provided.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="322b"></a>Ratification in 1897</p>

<p>The Paris acts, as adopted May 4, 1896, were ratified September 9,
1897, the declaration becoming effective immediately and the additional
act three months later. Both the additional act and the interpretative
declaration were ratified by Belgium, France, Germany, Haiti, Italy,
Luxemburg, Monaco, <a name="Page_323" id="Page_323"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 323]</span>Montenegro, Spain, Switzerland and Tunis.
Great Britain ratified only the additional act and not the interpretative
declaration, while Norway, which had become a unionist country April 13,
1896, ratified only the interpretative declaration and not the additional
act. Thus from December 9, 1897, the Berne convention and the Paris acts
together constituted, with the exceptions noted, the fundamental law of
the International Copyright Union.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="323"></a>Berlin conference, 1908</p>

<p>A second conference for revision was called in 1908 by the German
government, and met at Berlin October 14 to November 14, resulting in the
signature on November 13, 1908, of a revised convention continuing or
reconstituting the International Copyright Union and replacing by
substitution the Berne convention and Paris acts in those states accepting
it by ratification. To this conference the German government invited not
only the signatory powers of the Union, then fifteen,&mdash;Belgium,
Denmark (which had acceded to the Union in 1903), France, Germany, Great
Britain, Haiti, Italy, Japan (1899), Luxemburg, Monaco, Norway, Spain,
Sweden (1904), Switzerland, and Tunis; but also non-unionist countries, of
which representatives were sent from twenty countries,&mdash;Greece,
Holland, Portugal, Roumania and Russia, China, Persia and Siam, Liberia,
the United States of America, Mexico, Guatemala and Nicaragua, Argentina,
Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela. The working
committees were made up exclusively from representatives of the signatory
powers, only these countries participating in the votes; active
participation otherwise was confined to representatives of countries
expecting to become signatory powers, Holland and Russia, while the other
participants acted as observing representatives or supplied information on
request.</p>

<p class="sidenote"> <a name="324"></a>United States' position</p>

<p><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
324]</span>The United States delegate, Thorvald Solberg, Register of
Copyrights, was present only to make observations and report, with no
power to vote or to take part in the discussions, as stated in the remarks
for which, on October 15, he was called upon, as follows:</p>

<p>"In 1885 and 1886, at the conferences convened to draft the convention
to create the International Union for the Protection of Literary and
Artistic Property, the United States was represented. At that time,
however, it was not deemed possible to send a plenipotentiary delegate,
nor could such a representative be sent to attend the first conference of
revision which met at Paris in 1896.</p>

<p>"When the present conference was arranged for&mdash;early in the
year&mdash;the German ambassador at Washington wrote to the Secretary of
State of the United States a letter explaining the purpose and scope of
this congress, inviting the Government of the United States to send
delegates. The ambassador's letter explained that, in addition to
delegates representing governments in the union, there would be present
representatives from a considerable number of non-union nations. It was
further stated that the attendance of such delegates from non-union
countries would be greeted with special pleasure. This because of the
conviction that whatever might be the final position taken by the
non-union countries, or their laws, in relation to copyright,
participation in the proceedings of this conference by such delegates from
non-union countries would at all events contribute to arouse and increase
interest in the Berne Union and its beneficial work.</p>

<p>"The German ambassador's letter further explained that the delegates
from non-union countries attending the conference would have full freedom
of <a name="Page_325" id="Page_325"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
325]</span>action; that they might confine themselves to following the
discussions without taking any stand with regard to them, and that it
would be left to the discretion of the non-union governments as to whether
they would empower their delegates to join the Berne Union.</p>

<p>"The Government of the United States again finds it impracticable to
send a delegate authorized to commit the United States to actual adhesion
at this time to the Berne Convention. Nevertheless, it has been felt that
the representation of the United States, even within the limitations
indicated, might be beneficial: first, to indicate the sympathy of our
Government with the general purposes of the International Copyright Union;
second, to secure such information regarding the proceedings of the
conference as might prove valuable; and third, to place (by means of such
representation) at the disposal of the conference authoritative knowledge
as to the facts of copyright legislation and procedure within the United
States&mdash;information which it is hoped may be of use to the members of
the conference in their deliberations."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="325a"></a>Welcome of non-unionist
countries</p>

<p>In response to the participation of non-unionist countries, Prof. L.
Renault of the French delegation, Chairman at the working sessions of the
conference, spoke of the wisely liberal practice of including non-unionist
countries in the invitation, recognized "the difficulty which these
countries find in passing through the halting places," which the Union had
itself gone through, and referred with especial gratification to the
representation of Holland, Russia and the United States.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="325b"></a>Death of Sir Henry Bergne</p>

<p>The closing days of the conference were darkened by the fatal illness
of Sir Henry Bergne, head of the British delegation, who expired on
November 15, the day after the adjournment of the conference, at the <a
name="Page_326" id="Page_326"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
326]</span>successful culmination of work toward which he had given many
years of active and effective life.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="326a"></a>Berlin convention, 1908:<br />

<a name="326b"></a>"Literary and artistic works" defined</p>

<p>The Berlin convention included thirty articles, covering the same
ground as those of the Berne convention and the Paris acts, but somewhat
differently arranged, so that comparison is not quite direct. Article 1
reconstitutes the International Copyright Union. The expression "literary
and artistic works" is defined (arts. 2 and 3, covering previous arts.
IV-VI) as including "all productions in the literary, scientific or
artistic domain, whatever the mode or form of reproduction, such as:
books, pamphlets and other writings; dramatic or dramatico-musical works;
choregraphic works and pantomimes, the stage directions ('<i>mise en
scene</i>') of which are fixed in writing or otherwise; musical
compositions with or without words; drawings, paintings; works of
architecture and sculpture; engravings and lithographs; illustrations;
geographical charts; plans, sketches and plastic works relating to
geography, topography, architecture, or the sciences. Translations,
adaptations, arrangements of music and other reproductions transformed
from a literary or artistic work, as well as compilations from different
works, are protected as original works without prejudice to the rights of
the author of the original work." The contracting countries are pledged to
secure protection fully for these categories and for photographic works
and "works obtained by any process analogous to photography" and to
protect "works of art applied to industry" so far as domestic legislation
allows.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="326c"></a>Authors' rights<br />

<a name="327a"></a>"Country of origin"</p>

<p>The convention assures (art. 4, broadening art. II) to authors within
the jurisdiction of a unionist country for their works, whether
unpublished or published for the first time in one of the countries of the
Union, such rights in each other unionist country as domestic <a
name="Page_327" id="Page_327"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
327]</span>laws accord to natives, as well as the rights accorded by the
convention, "not subject to any formality" and "independent of the
existence of protection in the country of origin," and regulated
exclusively according to the legislation of the country where the
protection is claimed. The "country of origin" is defined as "for
unpublished works, the country to which the author belongs; for published
works, the country of first publication" and for works published
simultaneously in several countries within the Union (as also in countries
without the Union), the unionist country granting the shortest term of
protection. Published works (<i>&oelig;uvres publiées</i>) are again
defined as works that have been issued (<i>&oelig;uvres éditées</i>). "The
representation of a dramatic or dramatico-musical work, the performance of
a musical work, the exhibition of a work of art and the construction of a
work of architecture do not constitute publication."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="327b"></a>Broadened international
protection</p>

<p>Authors of a unionist country first publishing in another country of
the Union enjoy (art. 5) in the latter country the same rights as national
authors; and authors of a non-unionist country first publishing a work in
any unionist country enjoy (art. 6) in that country the same rights as
national authors and in the other Union countries the rights accorded by
the convention. This article greatly broadens the scope of the convention,
and by recognizing without formalities the rights of authors of
non-unionist countries, makes it of a world-wide inclusion for works
unpublished or first or simultaneously published within a unionist
country, to the full extent of domestic protection in each unionist
country, whether the country of origin does or does not grant
protection,&mdash;thus giving to citizens of the United States full
protection throughout unionist countries on the sole condition of first or
simultaneous publication within one of them. </p>

<p class="sidenote"> <a name="328a"></a>Term</p>

<p><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
328]</span>The convention takes the important step (art. 7) of providing
for a uniform term of "the life of the author and fifty years after his
death" in place of the respective national terms, with the proviso that if
this term should not be adopted uniformly by all the unionist countries,
duration shall be regulated by the law of the country where protection is
claimed, but cannot exceed the term in the country of origin. For
photographic and analogous works, posthumous, anonymous or pseudonymous
works, the term of protection is regulated by the law of the country where
protection is claimed, but may not exceed the term in the country of
origin. The exclusive right of translation is assured (art. 8) for the
entire term. Serial stories and other works published in newspapers or
periodicals (art. 9) may not be reproduced, but other newspaper articles
may be reproduced by another newspaper if reproduction has not been
expressly forbidden, on acknowledgment of the source, but protection is
not extended to news of the day or press information on current topics.
The right of extract is to be governed (art. 10) by domestic
legislation.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="328b"></a>Performing rights, etc.</p>

<p>The public representation or performance of dramatic, dramatico-musical
or musical works, whether published or not (art. 11), and adaptation,
dramatization or novelization, etc. (art. 12), are fully included; and
this protection applies (art. 13) to the mechanical reproduction of music,
with the proviso that this application shall not be retroactive and shall
be regulated in each country by domestic legislation. Infringing
mechanical musical appliances may be seized on importation even though
lawful in the country from which they come. Cinematograph and analogous
productions of literary, scientific or artistic works are included (art.
14) as subject to copyright protection. </p>

<p class="sidenote"> <a name="329a"></a>Other provisions</p>

<p><a name="Page_329a" id="Page_329a"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
329]</span>The provisions as to the identification of author or publisher
(art. 15) of the work, seizure of infringing works (art. 16) and domestic
regulation and supervision (art. 17) are continued. The convention is
applied (art. 18) to existing works, provided they have not fallen into
the public domain in the country of origin or by expiration of the term in
the country where protection is claimed.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="329b"></a>National powers reserved</p>

<p>It is specially provided (art. 19) that the convention does not prevent
"more favorable provisions" through domestic legislation "in favor of
foreigners in general"; and the right of any country to make special
treaties conferring more extended rights (art. 20) is continued.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="329c"></a>Organization provisions</p>

<p>The provisions as to the International Bureau made in the Berne
protocol are continued (arts. 21-23), and also those as to revision (art.
24) through conferences, to take place successively in the countries of
the Union. Accession of other countries (art. 25) and colonies (art. 26)
is to be made as heretofore, by notification through Switzerland, and it
is provided that acceding countries may adhere to the present convention
or those of 1886 or 1896. The present convention is made (art. 27) to
replace the Berne convention of 1886 and the Paris acts of 1896, but it is
specifically provided that the states signatory to the present convention
may declare their intention to remain bound by specific provisions of
previous conventions. The convention was to be ratified (art. 28) not
later than July 1, 1910, and was to take effect (art. 29) three months
thereafter, subject to withdrawal of any country by denunciation on one
year's notice, in which case the convention would still remain in force
for the other countries. It is specially provided (art. 30) that the
states which introduce into their legislation the new term of protection
<a name="Page_330" id="Page_330"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
330]</span>shall notify the Swiss government accordingly, and any
renouncements of reservations shall be similarly notified.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="330a"></a>Ratification in 1910</p>

<p>The Berlin convention was signed in that city November 13, 1908, by the
representatives of Germany, Belgium, Denmark, Spain, France, Great
Britain, Italy, Japan, Liberia, Luxemburg, Monaco, Norway, Sweden,
Switzerland, Tunis, the signatories being in alphabetical order according
to the French names of the countries. Ratifications were exchanged in
Berlin June 9, 1910, and the convention became operative September 9,
1910. The convention was ratified without reservation by Germany, Belgium,
Spain, Haiti, Liberia, Luxemburg, Monaco and Switzerland, and with
reservations by France and Tunis (as to works of applied art); Japan (as
to exclusive right of translation and the public performance of musical
works); Norway (as to works of architecture, periodical articles and
retrospective action). Denmark and Italy have not ratified the Berlin
convention and therefore remain under the Berne convention and Paris
additional act and declaration. Great Britain will be enabled under the
new copyright act to accede to the Berlin convention, but has hitherto
remained under the Berne convention and the Paris additional act, and
Sweden, not having ratified, remains under the Berne convention and the
Paris declaration. Portugal acceded in 1911.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="330b"></a>Official organ</p>

<p>The official documents of the International Copyright Union, and
especially accessions thereto, as well as current copyright information
from all parts of the world, are given in the <i>Droit d'Auteur</i>,
published monthly at Berne, under the able editorship of Prof. Ernest
Röthlisberger, from the Bureau of the Union, as its official organ.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="331a"></a>Montevideo congress, 1889</p>

<p>Three years after the Berne convention, a congress <a name="Page_331"
id="Page_331"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 331]</span>of seven of the
South American republics was held at Montevideo, at which a convention
with reference to literary and artistic copyright was adopted January 11,
1889. The Montevideo convention has been ratified by Argentina (1894),
Bolivia (1903), Paraguay (1889), Peru (1889), and Uruguay (1892), though
not by Brazil and Chile, which were also participants in the congress. It
was in general on the lines of the Berne convention, though no mention was
made of unpublished works. A work first published or produced in any one
of the signatory countries and protected in that country in accordance
with its requirements, was also accorded in the other countries the rights
secured in the first country, but not for a longer term than was given in
the country where protection was claimed. Dramatic works were specifically
and playright impliedly protected. Provision was made for the inclusion of
countries outside of South America, under which Belgium, France, Italy and
Spain have become parties to the convention, but only in relation with
Argentina and Paraguay.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="331b"></a>Pan American conferences</p>

<p>In the winter of 1889-1890, the first Pan American conference was held
in Washington, and at this a committee, of which Andrew Carnegie was the
United States member, reported in favor of the adoption of the Montevideo
convention. No action seems to have been taken, but it is probably this
convention which is referred to as the first Pan American copyright
treaty. The second Pan American copyright treaty, according to this
numeration, was that adopted at the Pan American conference in Mexico
City, signed January 27, 1902, at the same time with the patent and
trade-mark treaty. This copyright convention was modeled somewhat on the
lines of the Berne convention. At the Pan American conference in Rio de
Janeiro, 1906, what is spoken of as the third Pan <a name="Page_332"
id="Page_332"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 332]</span>American copyright
treaty, was adopted, and signed August 23, 1906, but this was really not
so much a new treaty, as a supplementary convention providing for the
development and regulation of international bureaus at Havana and Rio de
Janeiro, and its provisions were never put into operation. A fourth Pan
American copyright treaty, distinct from patent and trade-mark protection,
was adopted at the Pan American conference at Buenos Aires in 1910 and
signed August 11, 1910. The Mexico copyright convention was not ratified
by the Senate of the United States until 1908 and was proclaimed by the
President, April 9, 1908; the Rio convention has never been accepted by
the United States; the Buenos Aires convention, replacing that of Mexico,
was promptly approved by the U.&nbsp;S. Senate, February 16, 1911, but is
yet to be acted upon by the other countries.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="332a"></a>Mexico City conference, 1902</p>

<p>At the Pan American conference held in Mexico City in 1902, the second
copyright convention was signed January 27, 1902, by representatives of
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Chile, the Dominican Republic,
Ecuador, Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua,
Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and the United States, the delegates of Nicaragua,
Paraguay and the United States acting <i>ad referendum</i>.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="332b"></a>Mexico convention, 1902</p>

<p>The first article of the Mexico convention formed the signatory states
into "a Union for the purpose of recognizing and protecting the rights of
literary and artistic property," which was defined (art. 2) as including
"books, manuscripts, pamphlets of all kinds, no matter what subject they
may treat of and what may be the number of their pages; dramatic or
melodramatic works; choral music and musical compositions, with or without
words, designs, drawings, paintings, sculpture, engravings, photographic
works; <a name="Page_333" id="Page_333"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
333]</span>astronomical and geographical globes; plans, sketches and
plastic works relating to geography or geology, topography or
architecture, or any other science; and finally, every production in the
literary and artistic field, which may be published by any method of
impression or reproduction." Copyright was defined (art. 3) as the
exclusive right to dispose of the work, to publish, to sell and translate
it or authorize translation, and to reproduce it in any manner, in whole
or in part.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="333a"></a>Indispensable condition</p>

<p>The "indispensable" condition of copyright was (art. 4) a petition from
the author or his representative to the proper office, presumably of his
own government, with two deposit copies, and if he desired recognition in
other countries, with additional copies for each country designated, which
copies were to be forwarded to the respective governments accompanied by a
copy of the certificate of registration. Authors were secured (art. 5) in
each country the rights granted by their own government within the term of
protection of the country of origin&mdash;in works published in
installments, the term of copyright to date from the publication of each
part. The country of origin was defined (art. 6) as that of first
publication, or in case of simultaneous publication, that having the
shortest period of protection. The name or acknowledged pseudonym on a
work (art. 9) was accepted as indication of the author except on proof to
the contrary.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="333b"></a>Special provisions</p>

<p>Authorized translations or those of non-protected works (art. 7) could
be copyrighted as original works, but not to the exclusion of other
versions of the latter. Newspaper articles might be reproduced (art. 8) on
acknowledgment of source and author's name, if given; addresses before
legislative assemblies, court or public meetings (art. 10) might be freely
reproduced, <a name="Page_334" id="Page_334"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
334]</span>and extracts made (art. 11) in publications devoted to public
instruction or chrestomathy.</p>

<p>"Unauthorized indirect use" or reprint under pretext of annotations or
criticism (art. 12) was specified as unlawful reproduction. Pirated copies
might be seized (art. 13) in any of the countries, without prejudice to
other punishment of the infringer. Each country was to exercise (art. 14)
police power in its own jurisdiction. The convention was to become
effective for each signatory power three months after communication of its
ratification to the Mexican government, and any participant might withdraw
after one year's notice of denunciation, the convention to remain binding
on the other powers. The signatory powers were to declare (art. 16)
whether they would accept accession from countries unrepresented at the
conference.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="334a"></a>Ratification</p>

<p>The Mexico convention of 1902 was ratified by Guatemala (1902),
Salvador (1902), Costa Rica (1902), Honduras (1904) and Nicaragua (1904),
and by the United States (1908), perhaps also by the Dominican Republic
and Cuba, and does not seem to be operative in the other countries whose
representatives signed the treaty.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="334b"></a>Rio de Janeiro conference 1906</p>

<p>At the third Pan American conference, held at Rio de Janeiro, in 1906,
a convention was signed August 23, 1906, to protect patents of invention,
drawings and industrial models, trade-marks and literary and artistic
property, thus binding in one document patent and copyright protection.
This is usually referred to as the third Pan American treaty, but it has
not been accepted by the United States, partly because of objections to
patent provisions and the combination of copyright provisions with
them.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="335"></a>Rio provisions</p>

<p>This Rio convention re-adopted (art. 1) the Mexico treaty, with
modifications as stated in the convention. <a name="Page_335"
id="Page_335"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 335]</span>These provided for
two international bureaus (art. 2) for the centralization of registrations
(art. 3), one at Havana for the United States, Mexico, Central American
states, Panama, Colombia and Venezuela, Cuba, Haiti and San Domingo, and
one at Rio de Janeiro for Brazil, Argentina and the other South American
states, both to have (art. 4) identical systems and books, and to exchange
monthly authenticated copies of documents, so that the two should
practically constitute one bureau. The proper bureau was to receive (art.
5) from each country authenticated copies of its own registrations of
patents and copyrights for transmission (art. 6) to the other countries,
where they should be given full faith and credit, unless the proper bureau
be notified to the contrary within one year. The registration in one
country (art. 7) should have the same effect in each other country, as if
made in all, and the term of protection was made that provided by the
legislation of the country "where the rights originated or have been
recognized," or, if no term is specified, then for patents fifteen years,
for designs ten years, both subject to renewals, and for literary and
artistic copyright life and 25 years. The expenses of the bureau were to
be guaranteed (art. 8) by the several countries in the same proportion as
for the bureau of American Republics (now called the Pan American Union)
at Washington; the two bureaus were placed under the protection of Cuba
and Brazil under identical regulations, made by concurrence of the two
governments with the approval of the other countries; and an additional
registration fee, equivalent to $5, collected in the country of original
registration, was to be equally divided for the maintenance of the two
bureaus. The bureaus were authorized (art. 9) to (1) collect and publish
information, (2) print an official <a name="Page_336"
id="Page_336"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 336]</span>review, (3) to
advise the respective governments of defects, (4) to arrange for future
international conferences, (5) to make yearly report, (6) to exchange
publications with other institutions, and (7) to act as coöperative agents
for each of the governments concerned. The convention was to become
effective (art. 10) on the establishment of one of the bureaus for such
countries as should accede to the new convention, the other countries
remaining bound by the former convention; and each of the bureaus was to
be established (art. 11) as soon as two thirds of the countries in its own

act temporarily for the other countries. It was finally provided (art. 12)
that Brazil should be the intermediary for exchange of ratifications.</p>

<p>The Rio convention of 1906 was ratified only by Guatemala (1907 and

Chile (1910); and it never became effective.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="336b"></a>Buenos Aires conference and
convention, 1910</p>

<p>At the fourth Pan American conference, held at Buenos Aires in
1910,&mdash;twenty powers, including all the South American countries
except Bolivia, being represented,&mdash;the fourth copyright convention
was signed August 11, 1910. It undertakes to "acknowledge and protect the
rights of literary and artistic property," and includes (art. 2) with
dramatic and musical works those of a choregraphic character. It retains
(art. 4) the definition of the scope of copyright. The provision as to the
indicated author is continued (art. 5) in more precise language. It
substitutes for the previous cumbrous method the simple provision (art. 3)
"the acknowledgment of a copyright obtained in one State, in conformity
with its laws, shall produce its effects of full right in all the other
States without the necessity of complying with <a name="Page_337"
id="Page_337"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 337]</span>any other
formality, provided always there shall appear in the work a statement that
indicates the reservation of the property right." It continues (art. 6)
the Mexico provisions as to copyright duration. The country of origin is
further defined (art. 7) as "that of its first publication in America,"
and in case of simultaneous publication in several of the signatory
countries, then that having the shortest term of protection. It specially
provides (art. 8) that a work shall not acquire copyright through
subsequent editions. It continues also (art. 9) the provisions for
copyright in translations. It provides (art. 11) for the protection of
"literary, scientific, or artistic writings, ... published in newspapers
or magazines." But other articles may be freely reproduced, on
acknowledgment of the source, which, however, is not required for "news
and miscellaneous items published merely for general
information,"&mdash;the provisions as to extracts in journals for public
instruction or chrestomathy (art. 12) and those as to public addresses
(art. 10) subject, however, to the internal laws of each state, being
continued. The provisions as to unlawful reproduction (art. 13) are
continued, and seizure of pirated copies (art. 14), police powers (art.
15) and provisions for ratification (art. 16) are the same as in the
Mexico convention, except that the ratifications and denouncements are to
be communicated to the Argentine government. This treaty, approved by the
United States Senate, February 16, 1911, and signed by the President,
waits other ratification to become effective.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="337"></a>Attorney-General's opinion on
ratification<br />

<a name="338"></a>Relation with importation provisions</p>

<p>The Mexico convention was signed by the United States delegates <i>ad
referendum</i>, and before submitting it to the Senate for ratification,
the President obtained through the Secretary of State an opinion from the
Department of Justice, as to any reason against <a name="Page_338"
id="Page_338"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 338]</span>its submission for
ratification, especially with reference to the act of 1891. Acting
Attorney-General Hoyt replied in a confidential report of June 3, 1902,
since made public, after quoting the prohibition of importation in section
3 of the act of 1891: "In the convention now in question there is no
inhibition against such importations as are prohibited by said section 3,
unless it can be said that such convention is 'an international agreement
which provides for reciprocity in the granting of copyrights, by the terms
of which agreement the United States of America may, at its pleasure,
become a party to such agreement,' as provided in section 13 of the same
act. It is a matter of grave doubt whether this convention, made by the
United States originally, is such an 'international agreement.' It is
therefore quite probable that its ratification would except the authors of
the nations signing it from the provisions of said section 3 of the act of
March 3, 1891, leaving the authors of other countries still subject to
such provisions. Your attention is directed to the fact that an
affirmative answer to article 16 of the convention would also except from
the provisions of said section 3 all countries that might hereafter adopt
said convention. There appears to be no legal impediment to the
ratification of this convention, nor would it constitute a breach of faith
toward other countries; and in pointing out the probable effect of some of
its provisions I do not intend thereby to express or intimate an opinion
that it ought not to be ratified." The question of the relation between
treaty provisions and domestic legislation especially affects copyright
arrangements and has been the subject of discussion and a matter of
difficulty in England and other countries as well as in the United States.
The Senate did not act finally upon the Mexico convention until 1908, when
it was duly <a name="Page_339" id="Page_339"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
339]</span>ratified, and this precedent opened the way for more prompt
ratification of the Buenos Aires convention.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="339a"></a>United States international
relations</p>

<p>The United States, as a party only to the Pan American Union and not a
member of the International Copyright Union under the Berne-Berlin
conventions, has not secured for its citizens general rights of copyright
in other countries, without repetition of formalities, and such rights are
secured only in the countries designated by Presidential proclamation and
according to the formalities of their domestic legislation. It seems,
however, that citizens of the United States may obtain general protection
throughout the unionist countries by publishing in a unionist country
simultaneously with first publication in the United States, and thus
coming under the protective provisions of the Berlin convention. The
Mexico convention permits citizens of the United States to obtain
copyright in other countries ratifying that convention, by deposit at
Washington of extra copies for transmission to countries designated, with
certified copy of the registration. When the Buenos Aires convention is
ratified by other powers nothing more will then be required than the usual
application and deposit at Washington and notice of the reservation of
rights, preferably in connection with the copyright notice, of which "all
rights reserved for all countries" is the most comprehensive form.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="339b"></a>"Proclaimed" countries</p>

<p>Under section 8 of the act of 1891, the President "proclaimed" from
time to time the existence of reciprocal relations with other countries,
which permitted their citizens to obtain copyright in the United States
under the act, and American citizens to obtain protection under their
respective copyright laws. The question of the <i>status</i> of these
countries under the act of 1909 was solved by the proclamation of the <a
name="Page_340" id="Page_340"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
340]</span>President on April 9, 1910, stating that "satisfactory evidence
has been received that in Austria, Belgium, Chile, Costa Rica, Cuba,
Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain and her possessions, Italy,
Mexico, the Netherlands and her possessions, Norway, Portugal, Spain and
Switzerland, the law permits ... to citizens of the United States the
benefit of copyright on substantially the same basis as to citizens of
those countries," and proclaiming "that the citizens or subjects of the
aforementioned countries are and since July 1, 1909, have been entitled to
all the benefits of the said Act other than the benefits under section 1,
(<i>e</i>), thereof, as to which the inquiry is still pending"&mdash;the
exception being as regards mechanical music. To this list of countries,
Luxemburg was added by proclamation of June 29, 1910, and Sweden by that
of May 26, 1911.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="340"></a>Mechanical music reciprocity</p>

<p>Under date of December 8, 1910, the first proclamation with respect to
the international protection of mechanical music was made by the
President, declaring the existence of reciprocal relations with Germany.
Belgium, Luxemburg, and Norway were added by proclamation of June 14,
1911.</p>

<p>It may be repeated, to make the list complete, that by the ratification
in 1908 of the Mexico City convention of 1902, Guatemala, Honduras,
Nicaragua and Salvador, as well as Costa Rica, have reciprocal copyright
relations with the United States, making in all twenty-four countries
(including Japan under the treaties excepting translations, and China
under the limited provisions of the treaty of 1903) with which the United

<h4>THE INTERNATIONAL COPYRIGHT MOVEMENT IN AMERICA</h4>

<p class="p2 sidenote"><a name="341a"></a>Initial endeavor in America,
1837</p>

<p>Simultaneously with the earliest legislation for international
copyright among European states, there was a movement in the same
direction in the United States. In the Twenty-fourth Congress, February 2,
1837, Henry Clay presented to the Senate an address of British authors
asking for copyright protection in this country. This petition was
signed by Thomas Moore and fifty-five others, and was later supplemented
by additional signatures and by an American petition to the same
effect.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="341b"></a>The British address</p>

<p>The text of the address is as follows, the reference in paragraph seven
being to a letter by Dr. M'Vickar, printed in the New York
<i>American</i>, November 19, 1832:</p>

<p>"The humble address and petition of certain authors of Great Britain,
to the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States, in
Congress assembled, respectfully showeth&mdash;</p>

<p>"1. That your petitioners have long been exposed to injury in their
reputation and property, from the want of a law by which the exclusive
right to their respective writings may be secured to them in the United
States of America.</p>

<p>"2. That, for want of such law, deep and extensive injuries have, of
late, been inflicted on the reputation and property of certain of your
petitioners; and on the interests of literature and science, which ought
to constitute a bond of union and friendship between the United States and
Great Britain. </p>

<p><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
342]</span> "3. That, from the circumstance of the English language being
common to both nations, the works of British authors are extensively read
throughout the United States of America, while the profits arising from
the sale of their works may be wholly appropriated by American
booksellers, not only without the consent of the authors, but even
contrary to their express desire&mdash;a grievance under which your
petitioners have, at present, no redress.</p>

<p>"4. That the works thus appropriated by American booksellers are liable
to be mutilated and altered, at the pleasure of the said booksellers, or
of any other persons who may have an interest in reducing the price of the
works, or in conciliating the supposed principles or prejudice of
purchasers in the respective sections of your union: and that, the names
of the authors being retained, they may be made responsible for works
which they no longer recognize as their own.</p>

<p>"5. That such mutilation and alteration, with the retention of the
authors' names, have been of late actually perpetrated by citizens of the
United States: under which grievance, your petitioners have no
redress.</p>

<p>"6. That certain of your petitioners have recently made an effort in
defence of their literary reputation and property, by declaring a
respectable firm of English publishers in New York to be the sole
authorized possessors and issuers of the works of the said petitioners;
and by publishing in certain American newspapers, their authority to this
effect.</p>

<p>"7. That the object of the said petitioners has been defeated by the
act of certain persons, citizens of the United States, who have unjustly
published, for their own advantage, the works sought to be thus protected;
under which grievance your petitioners have, at present, no redress. </p>

<p><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
343]</span> "8. That American authors are injured by the non-existence of
the desired law. While American publishers can provide themselves with
works for publication by unjust appropriation, instead of by equitable
purchase, they are under no inducement to afford to American authors a
fair remuneration for their labours: under which grievance American
authors have no redress but in sending over their works to England to be
published, an expedient which has become an established practice with some
of whom their country has most reason to be proud.</p>

<p>"9. That the American public is injured by the non-existence of the
desired law. The American public suffers, not only from the discouragement
afforded to native authors, as above stated, but from the uncertainty now
existing as to whether the books presented to them as the works of British
authors, are the actual and complete productions of the writers whose
names they bear.</p>

<p>"10. That your petitioners beg humbly to remind your Honours of the
case of Walter Scott, as stated by an esteemed citizen of the United
States, that while the works of this author, dear alike to your country
and to ours, were read from Maine to Georgia, from the Atlantic to the
Mississippi, he received no remuneration from the American public for his
labours; that an equitable remuneration might have saved his life, and
would, at least, have relieved its closing years from the burden of debts
and destructive toils.</p>

<p>"11. That your petitioners, deeply impressed with the conviction that
the only firm ground of friendship between nations, is a strict regard to
simple justice, earnestly pray that your Honours, the representatives of
the United States in Congress assembled, will speedily use, in behalf of
the authors of Great Britain, <a name="Page_344" id="Page_344"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 344]</span>your power 'of securing to the authors the
exclusive right to their respective writings.'"</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="344a"></a>Henry Clay report, 1837</p>

<p>The British address was referred to a select committee, whose members
were Clay, Webster, Buchanan, Preston and Ewing, which reported favorably
a bill for international copyright. The report took high ground in favor
of the rights of authors:</p>

<p>"That authors and inventors have, according to the practice among
civilized nations, a property in the respective productions of their
genius, is incontestable; and that this property should be protected as
effectually as any other property is, by law, follows as a legitimate
consequence. Authors and inventors are among the greatest benefactors of
mankind.... It being established that literary property is entitled to
legal protection, it results that this protection ought to be afforded
wherever the property is situated.... We should be all shocked if the law
tolerated the least invasion of the rights of property, in the case of
merchandise, whilst those which justly belong to the works of authors are
exposed to daily violation, without the possibility of their invoking the
aid of the laws.... In principle, the committee perceive no objection to
considering the republic of letters as one great community, and adopting a
system of protection for literary property which should be common to all
parts of it."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="344b"></a>A prophecy of world union</p>

<p>The address of British authors and the Clay report called forth a
little volume of "Remarks on literary property" by Philip H. Nicklin, a
Philadelphia publisher, printed by his own firm of "law booksellers" in
1838, and dedicated to Henry C. Carey, which, though somewhat caustic in
its criticisms of some of the arguments put forward by the British
authors, heartily favored international copyright. The volume, in fact,
contains a glowing prophecy of what <a name="Page_345"
id="Page_345"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 345]</span>was realized in
large measure in the convention of Berne a half century later, the more
interesting as coming from an American publisher, who was perhaps first to
realize in thought the world-wide possibilities of the movement then in
its beginnings. He suggested that Congress should empower the President to
appoint commissioners to meet in Europe with similar representatives from
other nations "to negociate for the enactment of a <i>uniform</i> law of
literary property, and the extension of its benefits to all civilised
nations. It should be a new chapter of the <i>Jus Gentium</i>, and should
be one law (<i>iisdem verbis</i>) for all the enacting nations, extending
over their territories in the same manner as our law of copyright extends
over the territories of our twenty-six sovereign states; so that an entry
of copyright in the proper office of one nation should protect the author
in all the others."</p>

<p class="sidenote">"One just law"</p>

<p>"Public opinion has made such progress in the various civilized
nations, as would justify a great movement in favour of establishing a
universal republic of letters; whose foundation shall be one just law of
literary property embracing authors of all nations, and being operative
both in peace and war. Besides the great impulse that would be given by
such a law, to the improvement of literature and intellectual cultivation,
the fellowship of interest thus created among the learned men throughout
the world, would in time grow into a bond of national peace. Authors would
soon consider themselves as fellow-citizens of a glorious republic, whose
boundaries are the great circles of the terraqueous globe; and instead of
lending their talents for the purpose of exasperating national prejudice
into hostile feeling, to further the views of ambitious politicians, they
would exert their best energies to cultivate charity among <a
name="Page_346" id="Page_346"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 346]</span>the
numerous branches of the Human family, to rub off those asperities which
the faulty legislation of the dark ages has bequeathed to the present
generation, and to extend the blessings of christianity to the ends of the
earth."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="346a"></a>Clay bills, 1837-42</p>

<p>The Clay report, presented February 16, 1837, was accompanied by a bill
drawn by Clay, extending copyright to British and French authors for works
thereafter published, on condition of the issue of an American edition
simultaneously with the foreign edition or within one month after deposit
of the title in America, but it never came to a final vote, though
reintroduced by Clay in successive Congresses December 13, 1837, December
17, 1838, January 6, 1840, and January 6, 1842. In 1840, January 8, the
bill was reported back from the Judiciary Committee without recommendation
or approval. The bill was also introduced into the House of
Representatives by John Robertson, July 7, 1838, and by J. L. Tillinghast,
June 6, 1840, but here also there was no action.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="346b"></a>Palmerston invitation, 1838</p>

<p>An invitation was extended by Lord Palmerston in 1838 for the
coöperation of the American government in an international arrangement
with Great Britain, but nothing came of it.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="346c"></a>Efforts 1840-48</p>

<p>Dr. Francis Lieber, a well-known publicist, addressed to Senator
Preston, in 1840, a letter "On international copyright," prepared in
coöperation with George Palmer Putnam, and issued in pamphlet form by the
house of Wiley &amp; Putnam. Charles Dickens's tour in 1841 stimulated
interest in the subject, and there were high hopes of some result. In 1843
Mr. Putnam procured the signatures of ninety-seven publishers, printers,
and binders to a petition which was presented to Congress, setting forth
that the absence of international copyright was "alike injurious to the
business of publishing and to the best <a name="Page_347"
id="Page_347"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 347]</span>interests of the
people." A counter-memorial from Philadelphia objected that international
copyright "would prevent the adaptation of English books to American
wants." No result came from these petitions, nor from one presented in
1848 by William Cullen Bryant, John Jay, George P. Putnam, and others.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="347"></a>Everett treaty, 1853</p>

<p>In 1852 a petition for international copyright, signed by Washington
Irving, James Fenimore Cooper and others, was presented to Congress; and
in 1853 Edward Everett, then Secretary of State, negotiated through the
American Minister in London, John F. Crampton, a treaty providing simply
that authors entitled to copyright in one country should be entitled to it
in the other, on the same conditions and for the same term. This treaty
was laid before the Senate in a message from President Fillmore, February
18, 1853. The Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, through
Charles Sumner, reported the Everett treaty favorably, but it was tabled
in Committee of the Whole. Five New York publishers addressed a letter to
Mr. Everett, supporting a convention, providing the work should be
registered in the United States before publication abroad, issued here
within thirty days after publication abroad, and wholly manufactured in
this country. It was in this year that Henry C. Carey published his famous
"Letters on international copyright," in which he held that ideas are the
common property of society, and that copyright is therefore indefensible.
Several remonstrances were also presented against the treaty from citizens
of different states. The next year the amendatory article to the Everett
treaty was laid before the Senate in a message from President Pierce of
February 23, 1854, but no action resulted. </p>

<p><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
348]</span>In the Thirty-fifth Congress in 1858, Edward J. Morris, of
Pennsylvania, introduced into the House of Representatives a bill on the
basis of remanufacture by an American publisher within thirty days of
publication abroad, but it does not seem to have been considered, though
it was reintroduced by him in 1860.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="348b"></a>International Copyright
Association, 1868</p>

<p>The matter slumbered until 1868&mdash;after Dickens's second visit in
1867&mdash;when a committee consisting of George P. Putnam, S. Irenæus
Prime, Henry Ivison, James Parton, and Egbert Hazard issued an appeal for
"justice to authors and artists," calling a meeting, which was held under
the presidency of William Cullen Bryant, April 9, 1868. An International
Copyright Association was then organized, with Mr. Bryant as president,
George William Curtis as vice-president and E. C. Stedman as secretary,
whose primary object was "to promote the enactment of a just and suitable
international copyright law for the benefit of authors and artists in all
parts of the world." A memorial to Congress, asking early attention for a
bill "to secure in all parts of the world the right of authors," but
making no recommendations in detail, was signed by one hundred and
fifty-three persons, including one hundred and one authors and nineteen
publishers.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="348c"></a>Baldwin bill and report, 1868</p>

<p>In the Fortieth Congress, in accordance with instructions to the
Committee on the Library, moved by Samuel M. Arnell of Tennessee, January
16, 1868, to report on international copyright "and the best means for the
encouragement and advancement of cheap literature and the better
protection of authors,"&mdash;a bill was introduced in the House, February
21, by J. D. Baldwin of Massachusetts, which provided for copyright on
foreign books wholly manufactured here and published by an American <a
name="Page_349" id="Page_349"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
349]</span>citizen. The Committee's report said: "We are fully persuaded
that it is not only expedient, but in a high degree important to the
United States to establish such international copyright laws as will
protect the rights of American authors in foreign countries and give
similar protection to foreign authors in this country. It would be an act
of national honor and justice in which we should find that justice is the
wisest policy for nations and brings the richest reward." The bill was,
however, recommitted and never more heard of.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="349a"></a>Clarendon treaty, 1870</p>

<p>In 1870, what has since been known as the Clarendon treaty was proposed
to the American government by Lord Clarendon on behalf of the British
government, through Sir Edward Thornton, then British Minister at
Washington. This was modeled on the treaties existing between Great
Britain and other European nations, and provided that an author of either
country should have full protection in the other country to the extent of
its domestic law, on the sole condition of registration and deposit in the
other country within three months after first publication in the country
in which the work first appeared, the convention to continue in force for
five years, and thence from year to year, unless twelve months' notice of
termination were given. This was later criticised in Harper &amp;
Brothers' letter of November 25, 1878, as a scheme "more in the interest
of British publishers than either of British or American authors," on the
ground that British publishers would secure American with British
copyright, and give no opportunity to American houses to issue works of
English authors.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="349b"></a>Cox bill and resolution, 1871</p>

<p>The next year the following resolution, offered by S. S. Cox, was
passed by the House, December 18, 1871:</p>

<p>"<i>Resolved</i>, That the Committee on the Library be <a
name="Page_350" id="Page_350"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg

copyright, and to report to this House what, in their judgment, would be
the wisest plan, by treaty or law, to secure the property of authors in
their works, without injury to other rights and interests; and if in their
opinion Congressional legislation is the best, that they report a bill for
that purpose."</p>

<p>Mr. Cox had himself presented in the Forty-second Congress, December 6,
1871, a bill for international copyright on a basis of reciprocity,
providing foreign works should be wholly manufactured in the United States
and published by American citizens, and be registered, deposited and
arrangements for such publication made within three months of first
publication in the foreign country. This bill was supported in Committee
of the Whole by speeches from Archer Stevenson, Jr., of Maryland, and J.
B. Storm, of Pennsylvania, but opposed by William D. Kelley, of
Pennsylvania.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="350"></a>The Appleton proposal, 1872</p>

<p>Mr. Cox's resolution was acted upon in 1872 by the new Library
Committee, which invited the coöperation of authors, publishers, and
others interested in framing a bill. At meetings of New York publishers,
January 23 and February 6, 1872, a bill prepared by W. H. Appleton and
accepted by A. D. F. Randolph, Isaac E. Sheldon, and D. Van Nostrand, of a
committee, was approved by a majority vote. It provided for copyright on
foreign books issued under contract with an American publisher, "wholly
the product of the mechanical industry of the United States," and
registered within one month and published within three months from the
foreign issue, stipulating that if a work were out of print for three
months the copyright should lapse. This was in line with a letter printed
by W. H. Appleton in the London <i>Times</i>, October, 1871, denying that
there was any <a name="Page_351" id="Page_351"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 351]</span>disposition in the United States to
withhold justice from English authors, but objecting to any "kind of legal
saddle for the English publisher to ride his author into the American
book-market"; in response to which Herbert Spencer, John Stuart Mill,
Froude, Carlyle, and others had signed a memorial to Lord Granville
expressing a willingness to accept a copyright on the condition of
confining American copyright to American assigns of English authors, and
excluding English publishers. Mr. Appleton's bill was opposed in a
minority report by Edward Seymour, of the Scribner house, on the ground
that it was "in no sense an international copyright law, but simply an act
to protect American publishers"; that the desired "protection" could be
evaded by English houses through an American partner; and that the act was
objectionable in prohibiting stereos, in failing to provide for
cyclopædias, and in enabling an American publisher to exclude revised
editions.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="351a"></a>Philadelphia protest, 1872</p>

<p>A meeting of Philadelphia publishers, January 27, 1872, opposed
international copyright altogether, in a memorial declaring that "thought,
when given to the world, is, as light, free to all"; that copyright is a
matter of municipal (domestic) law; that any foreigner could get American
copyright by becoming an American citizen; and that "the good of the whole
people and the safety of republican institutions" would be contravened by
putting into the hands of foreign authors and "the great capitalists on
the Atlantic seaboard" the power to make books high.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="351b"></a>The Bristed proposal, 1872</p>

<p>The Executive Committee of the Copyright Association met in New York,
February 2, 1872, and put forward Charles Astor Bristed's bill securing,
after two years from date of passage, to citizens of other countries
granting reciprocity, all the rights of American citizens. </p>

Kelley, of Pennsylvania, introduced into the House, February 12, 1872, and
caused to be referred to the Library Committee, the following resolution:
"Whereas it is expedient to facilitate the reproduction here of foreign
works of a higher character than that of those now generally reprinted in
this country; and whereas it is in like manner desirable to facilitate the
reproduction abroad of the works of our own authors; and whereas the grant
of monopoly privileges, in case of reproduction here or elsewhere, must
tend greatly to increase the cost of books, to limit their circulation,
and to increase the already existing obstacles to the dissemination of
knowledge: Therefore, <i>Resolved</i>, That the Joint Committee on the
Library be, and it hereby is, instructed to inquire into the
practicability of arrangements by means of which such reproduction, both
here and abroad, may be facilitated, freed from the great disadvantages
that must inevitably result from the grant of monopoly privileges such as
are now claimed in behalf of foreign authors and domestic publishers."</p>

<p>The Library Committee gave several hearings on the subject, February 12
and later, and among other contributions to the discussion received a
letter from Harper &amp; Brothers taking ground that "any measure of
international copyright was objectionable because it would add to the
price of books, and thus interfere with the education of the people"; and
a suggestion from John P. Morton, of Louisville, to permit general
republication on payment of a ten per cent royalty to the foreign author.
The same suggestion, providing for five per cent royalty, as brought
forward by John Elderkin, was introduced, in a bill, February 21, 1872, by
James B. Beck of Kentucky, in the House, and John Sherman of Ohio, in the
Senate. </p>

presented the celebrated Morrill report of February 7, 1873, Senator Lot
M. Morrill being the chairman, including a tabular comparison of the
prices of American and English books. It said that "there was no unanimity
of opinion among those interested in the measure," and concluded:</p>

<p>"In view of the whole case, your committee are satisfied that no form
of international copyright can fairly be urged upon Congress upon reasons
of general equity, or of constitutional law; that the adoption of any plan
for the purpose which has been laid before us would be of very doubtful
advantage to American authors as a class, and would be not only an
unquestionable and permanent injury to the manufacturing interests
concerned in producing books, but a hindrance to the diffusion of
knowledge among the people, and to the cause of universal education; that
no plan for the protection of foreign authors has yet been devised which
can unite the support of all or nearly all who profess to be favorable to
the general object in view; and that, in the opinion of your committee,
any project for an international copyright will be found upon mature
deliberation to be inexpedient."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="353b"></a>Banning bill, 1874</p>

<p>This was decidedly a damper to the cause, and the movement lapsed for
some years, a bill submitted to the House on February 9, 1874, by Henry B.
Banning of Ohio, extending to authors the protection given to inventors,
on a basis of international reciprocity, attracting meanwhile little
attention.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="353c"></a>The Harper proposal and draft,
1878</p>

<p>The question rested until 1878, when, under date of November 25, Harper
&amp; Brothers addressed a letter to William M. Evarts, Secretary of
State, suggesting that previous failures were due "to the fact that all
such propositions have originated from one side only, and without prior
joint consultation and intelligent <a name="Page_354"
id="Page_354"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 354]</span>discussion,"
reiterating "that there was no disinclination on the part of American
publishers to pay British authors the same as they do American authors,"
and that "American publishers simply wished to be assured that they should
have the privilege of printing and publishing the books of British
authors"; indicating "the likelihood of the acceptance by the United
States of a treaty which should recognize the interests of all parties";
and proposing a conference or commission of eighteen Americans and
Englishmen&mdash;three authors, three publishers and three publicists to
be appointed by each side, by the American Secretary of State and the
British Secretary for Foreign Affairs&mdash;which should consider and
present the details of a treaty.</p>

<p class="sidenote">A suggested basis</p>

<p>They also presented, as a suggested basis of action, what came to be
known as the "Harper draft," a modification of the Clarendon treaty,
providing that there should be registration in both countries
<i>before</i> publication in the country of origin; that international
registration should be in the name of the author: if a <i>citizen</i> of
the United States, at Stationers' Hall, London; if a <i>subject</i> of her
Majesty, at the Library of Congress, Washington; and that "the author of
any work of literature manufactured and published in the one country shall
not be entitled to copyright in the other country unless such work shall
be also manufactured and published therein, by a subject or citizen
thereof, within three months after its original publication in the country
of the author or proprietor; but this proviso shall not apply to
paintings, engravings, sculptures, or other works of art; and the word
'manufacture' shall not be held to prohibit printing in one country from
stereotype plates prepared in the other and imported for this
purpose."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Approval of the Harper draft</p>

<p>This draft was approved by fifty-two leading American <a
name="Page_355" id="Page_355"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
355]</span>authors, including Longfellow, Holmes, Emerson, and Whittier,
in a memorial dated August, 1880. The American members of the
International Copyright Committee, appointed by the Association for the
Reform and Codification of the Law of Nations, John Jay, James Grant
Wilson and Nathan Appleton, also memorialized the Secretary of State,
under date of February 11, 1880, in favor of this general plan, specifying
"within from one to three months" as the manufacturing limit. It was also
approved by the great body of American publishers, although the Putnam,
Scribner, Holt and Roberts firms in signing took exception to certain of
the restrictions, especially to the time limit of three months. George
Haven Putnam set forth the views of his house in a paper before the New
York Free Trade Club, January 29, 1879, afterward printed as <i>Economic
Monograph</i> no. XV., "International copyright considered in some of its
relations to ethics and political economy." In this he suggested
simultaneous registration in both countries, republication within six
months, and restriction of copyright protection here for the first ten
years of the term to books printed and bound in the United States and
published by an American citizen.</p>

<p>An interesting series of replies from American authors, publishers,
etc., as to methods for international copyright, to queries from the
<i>Publishers' Weekly</i> will be found in v. 15, commencing with no. 7,
February 15, 1879.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="355"></a>Granville negotiations, 1880</p>

<p>The "Harper draft" was submitted in September, 1880, by James Russell
Lowell, then American Minister at London, to Earl Granville, who replied,
March, 1881, that the British government favored such a treaty, but
considered an extension of the republication term to six months essential,
and to twelve months much more equitable. In the same month <a
name="Page_356" id="Page_356"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 356]</span>the
International Literary Association adopted a report favoring an agreement,
but protesting against the manufacturing clause and time limit. This
position was also taken at several meetings of London publishers, and F.
R. Daldy was sent to America to further the English view. Sir Edward
Thornton, British Minister at Washington, was instructed to proceed to the
consideration of the treaty, provided the term for reprint could be
extended, and both President Garfield and Secretary Blaine were understood
to favor the completion of a treaty. With the death of Garfield the matter
ended for the time.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="356a"></a>Robinson and Collins bills,
1882-83</p>

<p>A bill dealing with the whole question of copyright, domestic and
foreign, was introduced March 27, 1882, by W. E. Robinson of New York, and
December 10, 1883, another copyright bill was introduced by P. A. Collins
of Massachusetts, but neither emerged from the Committee on Patents, to
which they were referred.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="356b"></a>American Copyright League<br />

<a name="356c"></a>Dorsheimer bill, 1884<br />

Criticisms and changes</p>

<p>The question came to the front again in 1884. A new copyright
association, the American Copyright League, had been organized in 1883,
chiefly through the efforts of George P. Lathrop, Edward Eggleston, and R.
W. Gilder, and there was a general revival of interest in international
copyright. On January 9, 1884, William Dorsheimer, of New York, introduced
into the House his bill for international copyright, which provided for
the extension of copyright to citizens of countries granting reciprocal
privileges, so soon as the President should issue his proclamation
accepting such reciprocity, for twenty-five years, but terminable earlier
on the death of the author. This bill was the occasion of a general
discussion. The Copyright League addressed a letter to Mr. Dorsheimer
urging the modification of the above limitations, and it was particularly
pointed out that the confining of copyright to an author's lifetime would
render literary <a name="Page_357" id="Page_357"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 357]</span>property most insecure. The League also
addressed a letter to the Secretary of State, urging the completion of a
treaty with Great Britain, to which F. T. Frelinghuysen replied, January
25, 1884, that while the negotiation as to the Harper draft had not been
interrupted, he thought the object might be attained by a simple amendment
to our present copyright law, based on reciprocity, after which a simple
convention would suffice to put the amendment in force. Mr. Dorsheimer's
bill was referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary, and reported
favorably, with amendments extending the copyright term to twenty-eight
years, without regard to the death of the author, with renewal for
fourteen years. The amended bill also provided that such copyright should
cease in case reciprocity was withdrawn by the other country; that there
should be no copyright in works already published, and that the provisions
of the domestic copyright law should, as far as applicable, extend also to
foreign copyrights. On the 19th of February Mr. Dorsheimer moved to make
his bill the special order for February 27, but his motion failed of the
necessary two-thirds vote, 155 voting aye, 98 nay and 55 not voting. There
was considerable opposition on the part of those who insisted upon the
remanufacture of foreign books in this country, and Mr. Dorsheimer
privately expressed himself as willing to accept, although not willing to
favor, amendments in that direction if they were necessary to insure the
passage of the bill.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="357"></a>American publishers' sentiment</p>

<p>A circular letter of inquiry sent out by the <i>Publishers' Weekly</i>
early in 1884, showed a general desire on the part of American publishers
in favor of international copyright. The replies were summarized in v. 25
from March, 1884. Of fifty-five leading publishers who answered, fifty-two
favored and <a name="Page_358" id="Page_358"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
358]</span>only three opposed international copyright. Out of these,
twenty-eight advocated international copyright pure and simple; fourteen
favored a manufacturing clause; the others did not reply on this point.
Congress adjourned, however, without taking definite action.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="358a"></a>Hawley bill, 1885</p>

<p>President Arthur, in his message of December, 1884, put himself on
record as favoring copyright on the basis of reciprocity. A bill brought
forward in the <i>Publishers' Weekly</i> of December 6, 1884, was intended
by a form admitting of easy amendment, to facilitate the passage of some
kind of bill extending the principle of copyright to citizens of foreign
countries under limitations set forth in subsequent sections of the bill.
The Dorsheimer bill was reintroduced by W. E. English of Indiana, January
5, 1885, and on January 6 Senator Hawley introduced a general bill into
the Senate. This latter, which covered all copyright articles, was
understood to be favored by the Copyright League; it extended copyright to
citizens of foreign states, on a basis of reciprocity, for books or other
works published after the passage of the bill, by repealing those parts of
the Revised Statutes confining copyright to "citizens of the United States
or residents therein." No action was taken, however, on either the
Dorsheimer or the Hawley bill.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="358b"></a>Chace bill, 1886</p>

<p>In his first annual message, 1885, President Cleveland referred
favorably to the negotiations at Berne, and with the opening of the
Forty-ninth Congress two bills were introduced into the Senate, that of
Senator Hawley, December 7, 1885, being essentially his bill of the
previous year, and that of Senator Chace, January 21, 1886, a new bill,
based on a plan put forward some years previously by Henry C. Lea, and now
supported by the Typographical Unions and other labor organizations. The
Hawley bill was on a simple <a name="Page_359" id="Page_359"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 359]</span>basis of reciprocity; the Chace bill
required registry within fifteen days and deposit of the best
<i>American</i> edition within six months from publication abroad, at a
fee of $1, to be used in printing a list of copyright books for customs
use, the prohibition of importations and the voiding of copyright when the
American manufacturer abandons publication. The American Copyright League,
of which James Russell Lowell was president and Edmund Clarence Stedman
vice-president, favored the Hawley bill, which was practically a
modification of the Dorsheimer bill, and it was introduced into the House
by John Randolph Tucker of Virginia, January 6, 1886.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="359a"></a>Congressional hearings, 1886</p>

<p>Hearings were held for four days by the Senate Committee on Patents on
January 28, 29, February 12, and March 11, 1886, at which Mr. Lowell, Mr.
Stedman, "Mark Twain" and others appeared on behalf of international
copyright. A memorial signed by 144 American authors, was presented in the
following terms: "The undersigned American citizens who earn their living
in whole or in part by their pen, and who are put at disadvantage in their
own country by the publication of foreign books without payment to the
author, so that American books are undersold in the American market, to
the detriment of American literature, urge the passage by Congress of an
International Copyright Law, which will protect the rights of authors, and
will enable American writers to ask from foreign nations the justice we
shall then no longer deny on our own part." The memorial was presented to
Congress in facsimile of the signatures of the authors and was reproduced
in that form in the Bowker-Solberg volume on copyright of 1886.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="359b"></a>Mr. Lowell's epigram</p>

<p>It was at this time that Mr. Lowell wrote his famous quatrain on
"International copyright," which presented effectively the fundamental
argument:</p>

<p><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 360]</span>
"In vain we call old notions fudge, And bend our conscience to our
dealing; The Ten Commandments will not budge, And stealing will continue
stealing."</p>

<p>On May 21, 1886, the Committee on Patents presented a report to the
Senate, favoring the Chace bill, but no action resulted.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="360a"></a>President Cleveland's second
message, 1886</p>

<p>In President Cleveland's annual message December 6, 1886, at the
opening of the second session, he called the attention of Congress to the
fact that "the drift of sentiment in civilized communities toward full
recognition of the rights of property in the creation of the human
intellect has brought about the adoption by many important nations of an
International Copyright Convention, which was signed at Berne 18th of
September, 1885.... I trust the subject will receive at your hands the
attention it deserves, and that the just claims of authors, so urgently
pressed, will be duly heeded." But the Congress adjourned without heeding
them.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="360b"></a>Campaign of 1887</p>

<p>Senator Chace reintroduced his bill into the Fiftieth Congress,
December 12, 1887. In the same month there was organized the American
Publishers' Copyright League, with William H. Appleton as president and
George Haven Putnam as secretary, and from that time forward the authors'
and publishers' leagues acted in close coöperation. Copyright associations
were formed in Boston, Chicago and elsewhere, to influence Congress and
the public; Henry van Dyke, especially by his address on "The national sin
of piracy," and other clergymen helped to emphasize the moral issue, and
authors' readings held in New York, Washington and elsewhere brought the
question widely to public notice and helped to raise funds for the
campaign. During this period, R. U. Johnson, associate editor of the
<i>Century</i> magazine, who had <a name="Page_361"
id="Page_361"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 361]</span>been treasurer of
the Authors' League, became its secretary, and throughout the campaigns
ending in 1891 and 1909, had the working oar. The Typographical Unions,
represented by John Louis Kennedy and James Welsh, gave support to the
bill conditioned on the acceptance of the type-setting clause, and the
opposition to it came chiefly from Gardiner G. Hubbard and certain legal
representatives of unnamed clients.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="361a"></a>Senate passage of Chace bill,

<p>The Chace bill, modified to require printing from type set or plates
made within the United States and to prohibit the importation of
foreign-made editions, passed the Senate, Senators Chace, Hawley, Hoar and
O. H. Platt of Connecticut being foremost in its support, by vote of 35 to
10, May 9, 1888. It had been introduced into the House by W. C. P.
Breckinridge of Kentucky, March 19, and favorably reported by the
Judiciary Committee, April 21, 1888. A bill which had been introduced by
Lloyd S. Bryce of New York, January 16, and referred to the Committee on
Patents, was favorably reported by that Committee with amendment September
13, 1888. But the Mills tariff bill and other circumstances blocked the
way, and the Fiftieth Congress adjourned without action by the House.</p>

1889<br />

Simonds bill, 1890<br />

Simonds report, 1890</p>

<p>President Harrison, in his first annual message, December 3, 1889, to
the Fifty-first Congress, said, "The subject of an international copyright
has been frequently commended to the attention of Congress by my
predecessors. The enactment of such a law would be eminently wise and
just." Senator Chace having resigned his seat, Senator O. H. Platt became
chairman of the Committee on Patents and the chief advocate of the Chace
bill, which he reintroduced December 4, 1889. In the House it was again
introduced by Mr. Breckinridge on January 6, 1890, and <a name="Page_362"
id="Page_362"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 362]</span> referred to the
Judiciary Committee, which made a favorable report, prepared by G. E.
Adams of Illinois February 15, 1890. It was also introduced on the same
day by Benjamin Butterworth of Ohio, as a Republican, and referred to the
Committee on Patents, of which he was chairman. A third bill was also
introduced on January 6, by W. E. Simonds of Connecticut, amending the
patent and trade-mark acts with an incidental reference to copyright. Mr.
Simonds presented a favorable report from the Committee on Patents
February 18, but no action was taken on this report. The main bill was,
however, reported from the Judiciary Committee by Mr. Adams, and on motion
of William McKinley of Ohio, was made the special order for May 2, when it
was debated, with amendments introduced by Mr. Adams and defeated on the
third reading by a vote of 99 to 125. The bill was reintroduced, however,
by Mr. Simonds with the inclusion of a reciprocity clause, May 16, 1890,
and on June 10 the Committee on Patents through Mr. Simonds presented a
strong report with a substitute bill, essentially the same. The Simonds
report set forth that aside from "practical reasons" for the bill, "it is
a sufficient reason that an author has a natural exclusive right to the
thing having a value in exchange which he produced by the labor of his
brain and hand. No one denies and everyone admits that all men have
certain natural rights which exist independently of all written statutes."
And in respect to international protection, the report said "the United
States of America must give in its adhesion to international copyright or
stand as the literary Ishmael of the civilized world." The report is
printed in full and a detailed account of the campaign for this bill is
given in G. H. Putnam's "The question of copyright." On December 3, 1890,
the bill was again <a name="Page_363" id="Page_363"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 363]</span>voted upon by the House and received a vote
of 139 to 95 on its
final passage.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="363a"></a>Senate debate, 1891</p>

<p>In the Senate there was a notable debate lasting six days, February 9,
12-14, 17-18, 1891, in which Senators Sherman and Carlisle championed an
amendment permitting the importation of authorized foreign editions which
was opposed by the Typographical Unions as violating the manufacturing
clause, and by authors and publishers as a restriction on authors' rights
of control. Senator Frye on February 9, 1891, advocated an amendment
extending the manufacturing clause beyond books to include maps, charts,
dramatic or musical compositions, engravings, cuts, prints, photographs,
chromos and lithographs. With these and other amendments, the bill passed
the Senate 36 to 14, February 18, 1891. On February 28, 1891, the House
voted 128 to 64 non-concurrence in the Senate amendments, and a Conference
Committee was appointed.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="363b"></a>Passage of act of March 4, 1891</p>

<p>This first Conference Committee, reporting on March 2, 1891, disagreed
on the Sherman amendment, and accepted the other Senate amendments; the
report was accepted by the House, 139 to 90, on March 2, 1891. The Senate,
on March 3, refused by a vote of 33 to 28 to recede from the Sherman
amendment, and a second Conference Committee was appointed. This second
Conference Committee modified the Sherman amendment, and after an
all-night session the copyright bill was passed, 127 to 77, by the House,
March 3, and was also passed, 27 to 18, by the Senate at half past two in
the morning, March 4, 1891.</p>

<p>The bill as passed was in the form of amendments to the Revised
Statutes, omitting the limitation to citizens or residents of the United
States, confining copyright, in the case of a book, photograph, chromo or
lithograph, to works of which the deposit copies <a name="Page_364"
id="Page_364"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 364]</span>should be "printed
from type set within the limits of the United States, or from plates made
therefrom, or from negatives or drawings on stone, made within the limits
of the United States or from transfers made therefrom," and extending
copyright to citizens of a foreign country only when such country protects
American citizens "on substantially the same basis as its own citizens,"
or is a party to international arrangements, as determined by proclamation
of the President.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Approval by President Harrison</p>

<p>The signature of President Harrison was promptly affixed before the
close of the legislative day, and the United States at last, though in a
restricted form, accepted international copyright after an exciting and
dramatic contest, which began more than half a century before. The bill
became effective July 1, 1891.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="364"></a>Review of the publishing
situation</p>

<p>There had been a continuous growth in the United States, though
displayed somewhat intermittently, of an active sentiment in favor of
international copyright. For some years the question was less insistent,
from the practical point of view, because of what was called "the courtesy
of the trade," by which a publisher who was the first to reprint an
English work was not disturbed by rival editions of that and of succeeding
works by the same author. Under this custom, the leading American
publishers voluntarily made payments to foreign authors, in many cases the
same ten per cent paid to American authors, and reaching in one case of
"outright" purchase of "advance sheets" $5000, though there was no
protection of law for the purchase. American and English works then
competed on much the same terms. In 1876 the cheap "quarto libraries"
were started, reprinting an entire English novel, though on poor paper and
often in dangerously poor type, for 10, 15, or 20 cents. They presently
obtained the advantage, by regular <a name="Page_365"
id="Page_365"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 365]</span>issue (one
"library" at one time issuing a book daily, others weekly), of the low
postal rates for periodicals, of two cents a pound, and thus obtained a
further advantage over books by American authors. These quartos gradually
gave way to the "pocket edition," in more convenient shape, but not always
in better print, at 20 or 25 cents. The sales of corresponding American
books had meanwhile definitely fallen.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="365a"></a>Lack of unified policy<br />

<a name="365b"></a>Compromise of 1891</p>

<p>The history of the movements for international copyright in America
shows that there had been no continuous and well-defined policy on the
part of the government authorities, or of publishers, or of authors. While
authors almost unanimously, and publishers generally, favored
international copyright, the division lines as to method were not between
authors and publishers, but between some authors and other authors, and
between some publishers and other publishers. There were those, in both
classes, who objected to any bill which did not acknowledge to the full
the inherent rights of authors, by extending the provisions of domestic
copyright to any author of any country, without regard to other
circumstances. There were others, at the other extreme, who opposed
international copyright unless it was restricted to books manufactured in
this country, issued simultaneously with their publication abroad, and of
which the importation of other than the American copies was absolutely
prohibited. The act of 1891 was finally passed with the assent of the
advocates of authors' rights who were willing to waive the abstract
principle in favor of any moderate measure which should be at least a
first step of recognition, and which might justify by its results, even to
the opponents of international copyright, further steps of future
progress.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="366a"></a>Need of general revision</p>

<p>While the act of 1891 was unsatisfactory to the <a name="Page_366"
id="Page_366"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 366]</span>friends of
copyright, who desired rather that the United States might grant
unrestricted international copyright and become a signatory power in the
convention of Berne, it was thought fair and right not to attempt broader
legislation for some years. Copyright legislation had become, however,
confused and uncertain in the multiplicity of statutes, and the need of
revision was emphasized in annual and special reports by Thorvald Solberg,
an expert in copyright and skilled bibliographer, who had been appointed
Register of Copyrights on the creation of that office in 1897 with the
approval of the Librarian of Congress, Herbert Putnam, who had been
appointed in 1899. In 1903 the Register of Copyrights presented a special
report on copyright legislation which was made part of the report of the
Librarian of Congress for 1903, and accompanied by a list of all copyright
statutes by the original states and by the United States, the text of the
revised statutes with notations of later provisions and a list of foreign
copyright laws in force, which three documents were also published as
separate pamphlets.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="366b"></a>Ad interim copyright act, 1905</p>

<p>In 1905, March 3, an act was passed granting <i>ad interim</i>
protection for one year to works in a foreign language published in a
foreign country, pending manufacture in America within one year of the
original work or a translation thereof. This protection was conditioned on
the deposit within thirty days from publication in a foreign country of a
copy of the foreign edition bearing copyright notice and a reservation in
the following form: "Published ______, 19__. Privilege of copyright in the
United States reserved under the Act approved March 3, 1905, by
______,"&mdash;which was also to be printed on all copies of the foreign
work sold or distributed in the United States. </p>

<p><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
367]</span>On January 27, 1905, Senator Kittredge announced (in Senate
Report 3380) that the Committee on Patents purposed to "attempt a
codification of the copyright laws at the next session of the Congress"
and in a letter to the Librarian of Congress suggested that he call a
conference of the several classes interested in such codification.
Accordingly on April 10, the Librarian of Congress announced such a
conference, of which sessions were held at the City Club in New York, May
31 to June 2, and November 1 to 4, 1905, and in the Library of Congress,
Washington, March 13 to 16, 1906. At these conferences, organizations
representing authors, dramatic and musical as well as literary, artists,
publishers, printers, lithographers, librarians, the legal profession and
the public, participated through delegates, and discussed first a basic
memorandum presented by the American (Authors) Copyright League and
thereafter successive drafts of a copyright measure prepared by the
Register of Copyrights. As a result of these discussions, presided over by
Librarian Putnam, the final draft was prepared under the immediate
direction of the Librarian of Congress, which became the basis of the bill
"to amend and consolidate the acts respecting copyright" introduced into
the Senate by Senator Kittredge (Senate bill 6380) and into the House by
Chairman Frank D. Currier (H. R. bill 19853), May 31, 1906.</p>

<p class="sidenote">"Copyright in Congress, 1789-1904"</p>

<p>In connection with these conferences, a number of valuable documents
were prepared by Register Solberg and published through the Copyright
Office, among them a chronological record of "Copyright in Congress,
1789-1904," with bibliography, summarizing all Congressional proceedings
in relation to copyright through the second session of the Fifty-eighth
Congress. </p>

<p class="sidenote"> <a name="368"></a>President Roosevelt's message,
1905</p>

<p><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
368]</span>Meantime President Roosevelt, in his annual message of December
5, 1905, to the Fifty-ninth Congress, had made strong recommendations in
favor of copyright reform: "Our copyright laws urgently need revision.
They are imperfect in definition, confused and inconsistent in expression;
they omit provision for many articles which, under modern reproductive
processes, are entitled to protection; they impose hardships upon the
copyright proprietor which are not essential to the fair protection of the
public; they are difficult for the courts to interpret and impossible for
the Copyright Office to administer with satisfaction to the public.
Attempts to improve them by amendment have been frequent, no less than
twelve acts for the purpose having been passed since the Revised Statutes.
To perfect them by further amendment seems impracticable. A complete
revision of them is essential. Such a revision, to meet modern conditions,
has been found necessary in Germany, Austria, Sweden and other foreign
countries, and bills embodying it are pending in England and the
Australian colonies. It has been urged here, and proposals for a
commission to undertake it have, from time to time, been pressed upon the
Congress. The inconveniences of the present conditions being so great, an
attempt to frame appropriate legislation has been made by the Copyright
Office, which has called conferences of the various interests especially
and practically concerned with the operation of the copyright laws. It has
secured from them suggestions as to the changes necessary; it has added
from its own experience and investigations, and it has drafted a bill
which embodies such of these changes and additions as, after full
discussion and expert criticism, appeared to be sound and safe. In form
this bill would replace the existing insufficient and inconsistent laws <a
name="Page_369" id="Page_369"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 369]</span>by
one general copyright statute. It will be presented to the Congress at the
coming session. It deserves prompt consideration."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="369a"></a>Congressional hearings, 1906-08</p>

<p>It was arranged that the two Committees on Patents of the Senate and
House should hold joint sessions for public hearings on the copyright
bill, and these hearings were held in the Senate reading room in the
Library of Congress, the first June 6 to 9, 1906, the second December 7 to
11, 1906, the third March 26 to 28, 1908, of each of which full
stenographic reports were printed for the Committees. At the first hearing
the discussions were largely on the general principles of copyright and
their special application to the right of musical composers to control
mechanical reproduction of their works. Amendments proposed at this
hearing were printed by the Copyright Office in two parts, and a third or
supplementary part gave the comment of the Bar Associations' Committees.
Register Solberg also printed as preliminary to the second hearing the
copyright bill compared with copyright statutes then in force, and earlier
United States enactments.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="369b"></a>Kittredge-Currier reports, 1907</p>

<p>In 1907, at the second session of the Fifty-ninth Congress, the
copyright measure was introduced by Senator Kittredge January 29, 1907
(Senate bill 8190), accompanied later by the majority report, February 5,
1907 (Senate report 6187), and a minority report, February 7, 1907 (Senate
report 6187; part 2); and by Chairman Currier January 29, 1907 (H. R. bill
25133), accompanied later by the majority report, January 30, 1907 (H. R.
report 7083), and by a minority report, March 2, 1907 (H. R. report 7083,
part 2). No action was taken at this session.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="370a"></a>Smoot-Currier, Kittredge-Barchfeld

<p>At the first session of the Sixtieth Congress, Senator Smoot, who had
become Chairman of the Patents Committee on the retirement from it of
Senator Kittredge, <a name="Page_370" id="Page_370"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 370]</span>introduced a majority bill December 16,
1907 (Senate bill 2499), and Senator Kittredge a minority bill December
18, 1907 (Senate bill 2900); and in the House, Chairman Currier introduced
the majority bill December 2, 1907 (H. R. bill 243), and A. J. Barchfeld
the minority bill January 6, 1908 (H. R. bill 11794). The Smoot-Currier
bills, practically identical, were less favorable to authors, particularly
in respect to mechanical reproductions of music, than the
Kittredge-Barchfeld bills; and in a pamphlet "The copyright bills in
comparison and compromise," prepared by R. R. Bowker in behalf of the
American (Authors) Copyright League in March, 1908, the features of the
several measures were compared and the views of the Copyright League set
forth in a combined measure, with annotations. The "canned music"
question, indeed, absorbed most of the time at the third hearing, in the
stenographic report of which a combined index to the several hearings was
printed.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="370b"></a>Washburn, Sulzer, McCall, Currier
bills, 1908</p>

<p>After the hearings, other bills were introduced into the first session
of the Sixtieth Congress by C. G. Washburn May 4, 1908 (H. R. bill 21592),
more fully representing authors' views; by Wm. Sulzer May 12, 1908 (H. R.
bills 21984, 22071), embodying views of dramatic authors; by S. W. McCall
May 12, 1908 (H. R. bill 22098), embodying an amendment to the
manufacturing clause as phrased by the American (Authors) Copyright
League, excepting from the manufacturing provision "the original text of a
foreign work in a language other than English," and by Chairman Currier
May 12, 1908 (H. R. bill 22183). But again no action was taken at this
session.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="371a"></a>Fourth Congressional hearing,
1909</p>

<p>At the short (second) session of the Sixtieth Congress the copyright
bills were reintroduced in the House by Mr. Barchfeld December 19, 1908
(H. R. bill 24782), by Mr. Sulzer January 5, 1909 (H. R. bill <a
name="Page_371" id="Page_371"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
371]</span>25162), by Mr. Washburn January 15, 1909 (H. R. bill 26282). On
January 20, 1909, a fourth public hearing, specifically on "common law
rights as applied to copyright," was given by the Copyright Subcommittee
of the House Committee on Patents, to which had been referred the
preparation of a final draft, which hearing was reported with the
inclusion of a communication of Arthur Steuart, Esq., Chairman of the
Copyright Committee of the American Bar Association, giving a careful
analysis of the several common law rights possible as to copyright
property. After this hearing there were further reintroductions of
copyright bills by Mr. Washburn January 28, 1909 (H. R. bill 27310), by
Chairman Currier February 15, 1909 (H. R. bill 28192), and in the Senate
by Senator Smoot February 22, 1909 (Senate bill 9440).</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="371b"></a>Passage of act of March 4, 1909</p>

<p>The Currier bill was referred to the Committee of the Whole February
22, when a report (H. R. report 2222) was presented. On February 26,
amendments were agreed to by the House Committee on Patents; on March 2
the bill had a further reading, and on March 3 was briefly discussed and
passed by the House. Senator Smoot had reported to the Senate March 1,
1909, with a report from the Committee (Senate report 1108), and on March
3 the bill as passed by the House was brought before the Senate, briefly
discussed, and passed. The exact votes were not recorded.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Approval by President Roosevelt</p>

<p>It had scarcely been hoped at the beginning of 1909 by the friends of
copyright that the act could be passed during the short session, but the
energy of Chairman Currier, complemented by Senator Smoot in the Senate,
carried the bills through, and on March 4, the last day of the
administration of President Roosevelt, himself an author of distinction
and member <a name="Page_372" id="Page_372"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
372]</span>of the Authors Club, he had the satisfaction of signing, as one
of his last acts, a copyright bill completely codifying the law of
copyright and greatly broadening international copyright. The copyright
code, as in force July 1, 1909, is printed with an index and with the
regulations adopted by the U.&nbsp;S. Supreme Court, as Copyright Office
Bulletin 14.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Code of 1909<br />

<a name="372"></a>Hopes of future progress</p>

<p>The code of 1909 made the manufacturing clause more drastic, though
freeing photographs from its provisions, by requiring in the case of
books, periodicals, lithographs and photo-engravings that they should be
completely manufactured within the United States, including printing and
binding as well as type setting, with requirement of affidavit from
printer or publisher in the case of books; but made on the other hand a
further approach to complete international copyright in freeing from the
manufacturing clause "the original text of a book of foreign origin in a
language or languages other than English," thus relieving a difficult
situation which threatened retaliation and the rupture of copyright
relations by Germany and other countries, and in extending protection to
mechanical music reproductions on a reciprocal basis. The hopes of the
friends of copyright will not, however, be fully realized until the
manufacturing clause, with the affidavit provision, is repealed, and the
United States enabled by Congress to join the family of civilized nations
as a signatory power in the Berlin convention.</p>

<h4>COPYRIGHT THROUGHOUT THE BRITISH EMPIRE</h4>

<p class="p2 sidenote"><a name="373a"></a>English and American systems</p>

<p>Copyright in America has been so much modeled on English statutes,
decisions and precedents, that the previous chapters have covered most of
the points of copyright law in the United Kingdom. There are two essential
points of difference, however, between the English and American systems.
British copyright has depended essentially upon first publication, not
upon citizenship; and registration and deposit, which are here a <i>sine
qua non</i>, have there been necessary only (except in the case of works
of art) previous to, and as a basis for, an infringement suit.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="373b"></a>First publication and residence</p>

<p>A book first published in the United Kingdom (England, Scotland, Wales,
and Ireland) has been <i>ipso facto</i> copyright, under the act of 1842,
throughout British dominions; and this protection was definitely extended,
by the act of 1886, to a work first published elsewhere in the British
dominions. This held whether the author were a natural-born or naturalized
British subject, wherever resident; or a person who was at the time of
publication on British soil, colonies included, and so "temporarily a
subject of the Crown&mdash;bound by, subject to, and entitled to the
benefit of the laws," even if he made a journey for this express purpose;
or, probably but not certainly, an alien friend not resident in the United
Kingdom nor in a country with which there was copyright reciprocity. Under
the statute of Anne, it was decided by the Law Lords, in the case of
Jefferys <i>v.</i> Boosey (overruling Boosey <i>v.</i> Jefferys), that a
person not a British subject or resident was not entitled to copyright <a
name="Page_374" id="Page_374"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
374]</span>because of first publication in England, but the statute of
1842 was construed to alter this. In the ruling case under the last-named
statute, Routledge <i>v.</i> Low, in 1868, Lords Cairns and Westbury laid
down explicitly that first publication was the single necessity, and that
copyright was not strengthened by residence; though Lord Cranworth
objected and Lord Chelmsford doubted whether this was good law. It was
because of this doubt that American authors had been accustomed to make a
day's stay in Montreal on the date of English publication of their books.
This decision was accepted by the law officers of the Crown and became in
1891 the basis for the reciprocal relations proclaimed by the President of
the United States.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="374a"></a>Variations in copyright terms</p>

<p>The copyright term in Great Britain has differed for the several
subjects of copyright, under the divers acts as stated in previous
chapters, the general term being for life and seven years or for forty-two
years, whichever the longer. Registration at Stationers' Hall has been
requisite only (except in the case of works of art) as preliminary to
suit, and infringement previous to registration was punishable. Deposit of
one copy in the British Museum has been required within a stated time from
publication, but only on penalty of fine and not forfeiture of copyright,
and the four university libraries might demand copies. Under the
international copyright acts, registration and deposit at Stationers' Hall
for transmission to the British Museum was requisite for foreign works;
but this was made unnecessary by the adhesion of Great Britain to the
International Copyright Union.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="374b"></a>The new British code</p>

<p>The Copyright Act, 1911, as amended by the Lords, which became law (1
&amp; 2 Geo. v. c. 46) on Crown approval December 16, 1911, provides a
codification for the British Empire as comprehensive as <a name="Page_375"
id="Page_375"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 375]</span>the American code.
The act covers as Part I, Imperial copyright, Part II, International
copyright, Part III, Supplemental provisions. The act extends throughout
His Majesty's dominions, but is not to be in force in a self-governing
dominion (Canada and Newfoundland, Australia and New Zealand, and South
Africa) unless enacted by the legislature thereof, either in full or with
modifications relating exclusively to procedure and remedies or necessary
to adapt the act to the circumstances of the dominion, in case of which
adoption the legislature may repeal the act or enact supplementary
legislation with reference to works first published or whose authors are
resident within the dominion. Thus the bill practically permits the
self-governing colonies to legislate independently, each for itself within
its domain. The act may also be extended by Orders in Council to English
protectorates "and Cyprus." Its provisions are also made applicable (by
Part II on international copyright) through Orders in Council to subjects
or citizens of foreign countries, directly or through separate action by
self-governing dominions, under conditions which practically cover
countries within the International Copyright Union under the Berne-Berlin
conventions, though these are not named in the act; and to countries
having reciprocal relations,&mdash;with authority to the Crown to withdraw
any benefits of the act from citizens of countries not giving reciprocal
protection. This code is based largely upon previous British practice,
though with considerable extension and improvement.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="375"></a>Scope and extent</p>

<p>Copyright under this code covers "every original literary, dramatic,
musical, and artistic work," first published within the included parts of
His Majesty's dominions, and in the case of an unpublished work, the
author of which was "at the date of the making <a name="Page_376"
id="Page_376"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 376]</span>of the work" a
British subject or a resident domiciled within such included parts [or
under protection through the international copyright provisions].</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="376a"></a>Publication</p>

<p>"A work shall be deemed to be published simultaneously in two places if
the time between the publication in one such place and the publication in
the other place does not exceed fourteen days," or such longer period as
may be fixed by Order in Council. Publication is expressly distinguished
from performance, exhibition or delivery.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="376b"></a>Definition of copyright</p>

<p>Copyright is defined to mean "the sole right to produce or reproduce
the work or any substantial part thereof in any material form whatsoever"
or any translation thereof, to publish, perform, or deliver the work in
public, to dramatize or novelize it, to make any record, roll, film or
other contrivance by which it may be mechanically performed or delivered
or to authorize any such acts. Architectural works of art are included as
to design but not process or method.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="376c"></a>Infringement and exceptions
thereto</p>

<p>Infringement is comprehensively and sweepingly defined to cover any
copying or colorable imitation of any copyright work or the doing by an
unauthorized person of "anything the sole right to do which is by this Act
conferred on the owner of the copyright." The code specifically excepts
from the provisions against infringement (1) any "fair dealing" for
private study, research, review or newspaper summary; (2) the use by an
artist who has sold his copyright in a work of moulds, sketches, etc.,
except to repeat or imitate the design of that work; (3) the making or
publishing of paintings, drawings, engravings, or photographs of a work of
sculpture or artistic craftsmanship, if permanently situate in a public
place or building, or (if not in the nature of architectural drawings or
plans) of an architectural work of art; (4) the use in collections
described and advertised as for school <a name="Page_377"
id="Page_377"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 377]</span>use, of extracts
from copyright works (not themselves published for the use of schools),
not more than two from any one author, and not duplicated within five
years by the same publisher; (5) the newspaper report of a public lecture,
unless specifically prohibited by exhibited notice; and (6) the reading or
recitation in public by one person of any reasonable extract.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="377a"></a>Term</p>

<p>The copyright term is for the life of the author and fifty years after
his death, with provision that after an author's death the Judicial
Committee of the Privy Council may, on allegation of the withholding of
the work, require grant of license to reproduce, publish or perform it.
Posthumous works, works the property of the Crown, photographs and
mechanical music reproductions, are protected for fifty years; but no
specific term seems to be indicated for anonymous or pseudonymous works as
such. Works of joint authorship are protected for fifty years after the
death of the author who <i>first</i> dies, or during the life of the
author who dies last, whichever the longer period, and such works may be
protected by action of any one of the authors. Twenty-five years, or for
existing works thirty years after an author's death, any person may under
specified conditions publish a copyright work on payment of ten per cent
royalty&mdash;following an Italian precedent. Compulsory license is also
provided for mechanical music reproductions, in case the author permits
any such reproduction&mdash;following the American provision. University
copyrights are continued in perpetuity only for existing copyrights.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="377b"></a>Ownership</p>

<p>The author of a work is the first owner of the copyright, except in the
case of a work done on order or in the course of contract employment. The
owner of a copyright may by an assignment in writing assign his rights
wholly or partially, and either generally or as limited to any part of His
Majesty's dominions, or <a name="Page_378" id="Page_378"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 378]</span>for the whole term of copyright or any part
thereof, or license accordingly. But no assignment otherwise than by will
shall be operative beyond twenty-five years from the death of the author,
when the copyright reverts to his natural heirs, following Spanish
precedent.</p>

<p>Registration provisions are altogether omitted from the new
measure.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="378a"></a>Deposit copies</p>

<p>Deposit is required at the British Museum within one month after
publication, "of every book published in the United Kingdom" on penalty of
fine not exceeding five pounds and the value of the book, and copies must
also be supplied to the four university libraries, and for specific
classes to the National Library of Wales, on demand&mdash;the "best"
edition in the case of the British Museum, and that of which most copies
are sold in the other cases.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="378b"></a>Importation</p>

<p>Importation of "copies made out of the United Kingdom ... which if made
within the United Kingdom would infringe copyright," is prohibited, on
notification in writing to the Commissioners of Customs (the Isle of Man
being specifically excepted from this provision), and similar prohibition
is authorized as to British possessions. The use in the section on
infringement of the phrase "imports for sale or hire," taken from the act
of 1842, involves a possible limitation of this prohibition which is
discussed in the chapter on importation.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="378c"></a>Remedies</p>

<p>The usual civil remedies are provided, actions being limited within
three years from the infringement. If the real name of an author, or in
the absence of such, the name of a publisher, is indicated on a work, that
is <i>prima facie</i> evidence of copyright ownership in the prosecution
of infringement. An infringer may be relieved from damages (but not from
injunction) on proving innocence; architectural infringements may <a
name="Page_379" id="Page_379"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 379]</span>not
be enjoined after commencement of the structure, but are punishable by
damages. On summary conviction any person who knowingly for sale or hire
or for trade makes, sells or lets, distributes, exhibits, or imports
infringing copies, shall be liable to a fine not exceeding forty shillings
for each copy or fifty pounds for the same transaction, or in the case of
a second offense, to imprisonment not exceeding two months; and similar
provision is made as to infringing performance. The summary remedies in
the musical copyright acts of 1902 and 1906 remain unrepealed.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="379a"></a>General relations</p>

<p>The provisions of the code are extended to cover existing copyrights.
Common law rights are specifically abrogated by provision confining the
protection of an unpublished as well as a published work to statutory
provisions.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="379b"></a>Acts repealed</p>

<p>The measure repeals all existing enactments except sections seven and
eight (modified) of the fine arts copyright act, 1862 (25 &amp; 26 Vict.
c. 68), which deal with fraudulent signature or marketing of art works and
concern fraud rather than copyright, and the musical copyright acts of
1902 and 1906, providing summary remedies for piracy of musical works; and
the provisions regarding copyrights of the customs and revenue acts are
continued with modifications conforming them to this act.</p>

<p>The act does not apply to designs capable of being registered under the
patents and designs act, 1907. Schedules of existing and corresponding
rights and of enactments repealed are appended to the bill. The act is
effective July 1, 1912, unless earlier made effective by Order in
Council.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="379c"></a>Changes from original bill</p>

<p>It may be noted that the new British measure had been much
modified,&mdash;especially in the Committee stage, where efforts to
reconcile conflicting interests <a name="Page_380" id="Page_380"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 380]</span>were chiefly effective,&mdash;since its
introduction as a Government measure in 1910. In the earlier form it was
provided that the contributor of an article or contribution, periodical
articles included, might retain a specific copyright except as against the
proprietor of a collective work, and that an article in a newspaper, not
being a tale or serial story, might be reproduced in another newspaper in
default of a notice expressly forbidding it, providing the source were
duly acknowledged. University copyrights, new as well as old, it was then
proposed should still be perpetual. Copyright, it was specifically
provided, should not pass from an artist when he sells his original work
except by agreement in writing, but subsequent transfers of the original
work from an owner also of the copyright, should transfer the
copyright&mdash;but this is probably taken as implied in the new law.
Registration at Stationers' Hall was continued and made applicable to all
classes of works, and though optional, it was practically necessitated by
the ingenious provision that in the absence of such registration an
infringer might plead ignorance and be freed from damages. The summary
provisions of the musical copyright acts were extended to cover other
works, and these acts it was therefore proposed to repeal. The compulsory
license provision limiting musical copyright and certain provisions as to
ownership and term were introduced in the Committee stage. The word
"infringing" was substituted for "piratical" in Parliamentary debate to
conciliate a supersensitive member. The compromises and modifications
indicated brought the measure before Parliament as an "agreed upon"
bill.</p>

<a name="381a"></a>Channel Islands</p>

<p>The Isle of Man applies the copyright law of the United Kingdom, and
has a supplementary law of 1907, applying British legislation on
engravings and <a name="Page_381" id="Page_381"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 381]</span>prints, sculpture, paintings, etc., and
musical compositions, quite up to date, embodying in the latter section
the latest provisions as to summary proceedings in the protection of
music&mdash;this being enacted by "the Deemsters and Keys in Tynwald
assembled," as the tiny Manx parliament is quaintly called. The Channel
Islands of Jersey and Guernsey also apply British copyright law by
ordinances or local legislation in their respective domains.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="381b"></a>International relations</p>

<p>Great Britain was one of the original parties to the Berne convention
and accepted the additional act, but not the interpretative declaration of
Paris, and the passage of the new measure will permit adhesion to the
Berlin convention. She has a special treaty with Austria-Hungary (1893),
sometimes cited as the treaty of Vienna of 1893, and has been in
reciprocal relation with the United States as a "proclaimed" country since
July 1, 1891.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="381c"></a>Colonial relations</p>

<p>The British dominions outside of the United Kingdom and Ireland are, in
general, under the like provisions of Imperial copyright law, including
the law of 1842 and earlier unrepealed or subsequent acts, the colonial
copyright act of 1847 and the international copyright act of 1886 being
especially important. They are also generally included under British
international relations embracing the Berne-Paris provisions of the
International Copyright Union and the reciprocal relations with the United
States, but with the exception that in the Austria-Hungary treaty, Canada,
New South Wales and Tasmania (both now part of the Australian
Commonwealth), and Cape Colony (now part of the Union of South Africa) are
not parties, because these colonies did not exercise the right of
ratification specifically reserved to individual colonies.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Judicial confirmation</p>

<p>The application of the Berne convention to the British possessions was
upheld in an important <a name="Page_382" id="Page_382"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 382]</span>Canadian decision, when in 1906 Justice
Fortin, in Mary <i>v.</i> Hubert, in the Quebec Court of King's Bench,
held that the British international copyright act in relation with the
Berne convention protected a French work from Canadian reprint, though the
author had not complied with specific Canadian requirements,&mdash;a most
significant decision in defense of international copyright.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="382"></a>Local legislation</p>

<p>Under the colonial copyright act of 1847, which declared local
legislation or decrees repugnant to the Imperial law to be null and void,
local legislation consonant with Imperial acts was permitted, subject to
approval by the Crown through Orders in Council, in which case prohibition
of importation of foreign reprints might be suspended by Order in Council
with regard to the particular colony. Under this act, local legislation
with special provisions existed in British India and other colonies, as
well as in the "self-governing dominions," which last now include Canada
and Newfoundland, Australia and New Zealand, and South Africa, and which
have somewhat greater powers of local legislation. Under these local
provisions, the Imperial law still prevails, local legislation being
concurrent but not necessarily co-terminous with it, as is particularly
noticeable in Canada, where there has been more or less conflict between
the Imperial and Dominion authorities. Local protection may thus be
extended, for instance, to works not first published within the British
possessions, or in a unionist country, but copyright cannot be denied to
works thus first published; and the Crown disapproves or disallows laws or
provisions construed by the Imperial authorities to be repugnant to
Imperial law. More than a score of colonies have adopted local laws or
ordinances, some of which have been disallowed by the Crown. The
<i>status</i> of copyright in the several colonies <a name="Page_383"
id="Page_383"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 383]</span>is thus indefinite
and confusing, even to the best-informed English jurists, and can seldom
be stated with certainty. Under the new British code, the "self-governing
dominions" will have the right to accept the Imperial code, either
completely or with adaptation to local judicial methods, or to legislate
independently.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="383a"></a>Canadian copyright history</p>

<p>In respect to the colonies now constituting the Dominion of Canada,
before British copyright protection had been definitely extended to works
first published outside the United Kingdom, Lower Canada in 1832, Canada
(upper) in 1841 and Nova Scotia in 1847 had passed copyright statutes to
protect authors of books first published in the respective provinces. On
the passage of the Imperial act of 1847, authorizing the suspension of
that portion of the act of 1842 which prohibited the importation of
foreign reprints of British copyright works, as to any colony in which
provision should be made by local legislation for protecting the rights of
British authors, Orders in Council were passed for Nova Scotia and New
Brunswick in 1848 and for Canada in 1850, suspending such prohibition,
following satisfactory protection accorded by local acts in those years.
These local acts provided for the collection of an impost on foreign
reprints of works by British authors in favor of the author or copyright
owner.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="383b"></a>Dominion of Canada: early acts</p>

<p>In 1867 the British North America act (30 &amp; 31 Victoria, c. 3) was
passed, providing for the union of Canada and the other North American
provinces (except Newfoundland) under the title of the Dominion of Canada,
and section 91 of this act specified copyright among the subjects which
were to be within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada.
At the first session of the first Dominion Parliament in 1868, a general
copyright act was accordingly <a name="Page_384" id="Page_384"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 384]</span>passed, which was followed in the same year
by an act continuing the customs duty of 12-1/2 per cent on foreign
reprints of British copyright works, and an Imperial Order in Council was
passed July 7, 1868, continuing Canada within the provisions of the
foreign reprints act of 1847. The returns to British authors from this
duty proved so small&mdash;only £1084 in ten years&mdash;that there was
much dissatisfaction, and this impost was finally discontinued in 1895,
whereupon the suspension under the Imperial act of 1847 of the prohibition
of importation ceased to be in force in Canada and foreign reprints of
British copyright works were again under the Imperial law prohibited.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="384"></a>Acts of 1875</p>

<p>In 1872 a new Canadian copyright act was passed, but it was disallowed
by the Imperial authorities, whereupon, in 1875, the Parliament of Canada
passed a new act, carefully drawn to avoid conflict with Imperial
legislation. To remove any doubts as to its validity, the "Canada
copyright act" of 1875 was passed by the British Parliament to authorize
the royal assent. This Imperial act forbade the importation into the
United Kingdom of colonial reprints, though authorized for the Canadian
market by British authors (and therefore not piracies), of any work which
might be copyrighted in Canada, and in which copyright subsisted in the
United Kingdom. The Canadian act of 1875 then received the approval of the
Crown, and as replaced and substantially re-enacted by the Revised
Statutes of Canada, 1886 (c. 62),&mdash;which also included (as c. 37) the
amendatory act of 1886, prohibiting the importation of "reprints of
Canadian copyright works and reprints of British copyrighted works which
have been also copyrighted in Canada,"&mdash;is still in force, being now
Revised Statutes, 1906, c. 70, pt. I, as the fundamental Canadian <a
name="Page_385" id="Page_385"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
385]</span>copyright law, subject to amendments since passed and approved.
The Imperial and Canadian laws of 1875, taken together, make it possible
to issue in Canada cheaper reprints of British copyright works, by
arrangement with the author or copyright owner, without interfering with
the more costly English editions.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="385a"></a>License acts disallowed</p>

<p>It should here be noted that the Canadian act of 1889, as amended by
the Canadian act of 1895, constituting Part II of chapter 70 of the
Revised Statutes, 1906, has never been approved and brought into force by
proclamation of the Governor-General. The act of 1889, following the
Imperial international copyright act of 1886, extended Canadian copyright
on condition of registration with the Minister of Agriculture, and
printing and publication or production in Canada within one month after
publication or production elsewhere, and provided that the Minister of
Agriculture might grant licenses, not exclusive, for the production of
works not thus protected on an undertaking to pay to the author ten per
cent royalty on the retail price, in which case importation of
foreign-made (but not British) editions might be prohibited during the
copyright period. The act of 1895 extended this license system to works
which the copyright proprietor failed to keep in print in Canada, unless
he should give satisfactory assurance of prompt reissue. These acts, as
noted, never became effective.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="385b"></a>The Fisher act, 1900</p>

<p>In 1900 an amendment to the copyright act was passed which is sometimes
referred to as the Fisher act. It provides that if a book, as to which
there is subsisting Canadian copyright under the copyright act, has first
been published in any part of the British dominions other than Canada, and
the owner of the copyright has granted a license to reproduce in <a
name="Page_386" id="Page_386"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
386]</span>Canada an edition of such book designed for sale in Canada
only, the Minister of Agriculture may prohibit the importation into
Canada, except with the written consent of the licensee, of any copies of
such book printed elsewhere, excepting two copies each for the use of
public or institution libraries. There is some question as to the
compatibility of this act with Imperial law.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="386a"></a>Minor acts<br />

<a name="386b"></a>Short form of notice</p>

<p>An act of 1887 had authorized the transfer from the Minister of
Agriculture to the Minister of Trade and Commerce of the registration of
industrial designs and trade-marks, but this transfer has never taken
place. The acts of 1890 and 1891 provided for copyright suits in the
Exchequer Court of Canada in the name of the Attorney-General or at the
suit of any person interested. The act of 1895 also contained a provision
adding to the two deposit copies required for Canada a third for deposit
in the British Museum. Finally an act of 1908 substituted the short form
of copyright notice, "Copyright, Canada, 19__, by A. B." This completes
the history of Canadian copyright legislation.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="386c"></a>Proposed Canadian copyright code,
1911</p>

<p>The copyright legislation of Canada will presently be replaced by a
comprehensive code, utilizing the permission granted by the new Imperial
copyright measure to self-governing dominions. The new bill, of which the
original text, as submitted to Parliament April 26, 1911, is given in full
in the appendix, will establish relations between the Dominion of Canada
and the Imperial authority closely similar to those established by the
Australian act of 1905, between that Commonwealth and the home government.
It pushes still further the precedent of "protection to home industries"
followed by American copyright legislation since 1891, and is a far more
drastic measure, evidently in retaliation against the <a name="Page_387"
id="Page_387"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 387]</span>United States and
with preferential relations toward Great Britain in view. Americans can
scarcely criticize, however, the logical application in Canada of
legislation on this side of the border. Copyright is to "subsist in every
original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic work the author of which
was at the date of making the work a <i>bona fide</i> resident in Canada,"
not first published outside Canada (simultaneous publication being defined
as within fourteen days), conditioned on registry before publication, and
the manufacture of every copy within Canada. One registration of a
periodical is to protect all future issues. Copyright it is proposed to
define broadly, as in the new English bill, including the right "if the
work is unpublished, to publish the work," thus bringing unpublished works
within the statute law and probably excepting them from common law
protection; and protection against mechanical music reproduction is also
to be included. The term is to be for the life of the author and fifty
years thereafter, with the new British proviso as to works of joint
authorship, that the term is to be for the life of the author who dies
first and fifty years thereafter, or the life of the author who dies last,
whichever period is the longer. Assignment of copyright must be in
accordance with the acts, and be registered. Importation of copies made
out of the British dominions is prohibited. In case of a license for a
Canadian edition of a book, copies printed elsewhere may be prohibited
importation, except two copies for library use. Copyright may also be
extended to foreign citizens under arrangements made by the governor in
Council. British subjects resident elsewhere than in Canada may be brought
under the act by Order in Council.</p>

<a name="388b"></a>Requisites for domestic copyright</p>

<p><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
388]</span>The Imperial and Canadian copyright laws, apparently a
complexity of complexities, are construed with relation to each other and
thus do not conflict. Each is good <i>pro tanto</i>. The Canadian
copyright law permits any person domiciled in Canada or in any part of the
British possessions, or any citizen of any country which has an
international copyright treaty with the United Kingdom, who is the author
of a literary, scientific or artistic work, to obtain copyright in Canada
for twenty-eight years, with a right of renewal for fourteen years to the
author, if living, or to his widow or children, if he is dead, conditioned
on re-registration within one year <i>after</i> the expiration of the
original term, publication of a renewal notice in the Canadian Gazette and
fulfillment of the obligations of original copyright. The requirements for
obtaining domestic copyright in Canada are that the work shall be printed
and published in Canada, shall be registered and three copies thereof
deposited at the Department of Agriculture (Copyright Branch) before
publication, and that each copy published shall bear the notice as cited
above. In the case of paintings, drawings and sculpture, the original work
may be protected by deposit of a written description instead of
copies.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="388c"></a>Imperial and local protection</p>

<p>Under the Imperial copyright act of 1886, providing that a book first
published in any part of the British dominions shall have copyright
throughout those dominions, works are protected in Canada under that act.
Subjects or citizens of a country which has no international copyright
relations with the United Kingdom may obtain copyright in Canada under the
Canadian law by showing that they have British copyright in the work and
complying with the other Canadian requirements. Copyright obtained under
the Canadian copyright law, so far as it relates to books first published
in the British dominions, is in addition to and concurrent though not
co-terminous <a name="Page_389" id="Page_389"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 389]</span>with Imperial copyright. The Copyright
Branch in the Department of Agriculture is in charge of the Registrar of
Copyrights, Trade Marks and Designs, a post filled since 1906 by P. E.
Ritchie, Esq. Canadian copyright may be obtained in a work although the
Imperial copyright may have been lost by reason of first publication
having been made outside of the British dominions or treaty relationship,
the Canadian law providing that literary works may be protected when
printed and published in Canada, whether they are so published for the
first time or contemporaneously with or subsequently to publication
elsewhere.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="389a"></a>Additional local protection</p>

<p>Canadian copyright also affords additional protection and relief not
granted by Imperial copyright, by provisions (1) that the importation into
Canada of foreign reprints of Canadian copyright works is prohibited, and
(2) that every person who knowingly prints, publishes, sells, or exposes
for sale any piratical copy of a copyright work shall forfeit every such
copy to the copyright owner and shall pay for every such copy found in his
possession, printed, published or exposed for sale by him not more than
one dollar and not less than ten cents, one half of which shall belong to
the copyright owner.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="389b"></a>Application for copyright</p>

<p>An applicant for Canadian copyright, either the proprietor or his
authorized agent, whether domiciled in Canada or other British possessions
or a citizen of a country having an international copyright treaty with
Great Britain, should make application to the Minister of Agriculture
(Copyright Branch), Ottawa, Canada, for which statutory forms are provided
from that office, attested by two witnesses and accompanied by a fee of
one dollar for copyright registration, or fifty cents in case of
<i>interim</i> or temporary copyright, and three copies of the book (full
<a name="Page_390" id="Page_390"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
390]</span>bound), map (mounted), etc., as printed and published in
Canada, or written description of a work of art. A book must bear the
statutory copyright notice, but a work of art the signature of the artist
only. An author or his legal representative may obtain <i>interim</i>
copyright pending publication or republication in Canada or temporary
copyright during serial publication, by registering the designation or
title of a work. Thus a citizen of the United States may protect his work
in Canada through international copyright by first publication in the
British dominions and also through Canadian copyright, with additional
protection, by complying with the requirements of the Canadian law, which
are in some respects closely parallel with those of the United States.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="390"></a>Newfoundland</p>

<p>In Newfoundland, always a separate colony and now a self-governing
dominion separate from the Dominion of Canada, an act of 1849 for the
protection of British authors was followed by an Order in Council of the
same year extending to that colony the provisions of the Imperial act of
1847. It made provision, following the precedent of Canada, for a customs
duty on foreign reprints of British copyright works, which provision was
re-enacted in the Consolidated Statutes of 1872 as chapter 53 and again in
the Consolidated Statutes of 1892 as chapter 111, the duty being at twenty
per cent. In 1890 a copyright act was passed, which remains the
fundamental copyright act of Newfoundland, as included in the Consolidated
Statutes of 1892 as chapter 110, supplemented by chapter 111, as above
indicated. These two chapters have been amended only by the act of 1898
placing copyrights, patents and trade marks under the jurisdiction of the
Colonial Secretary, an officer provided for in the act, and the act of
1899 reducing the copyright <a name="Page_391" id="Page_391"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 391]</span>fee of one dollar to twenty-five cents in
the case of photographs. Copyright in Newfoundland is on the same general
lines as in Canada, following in large part the precedent of the United
States, and is for a term of twenty-eight years with renewal for fourteen
years&mdash;local protection as distinguished from Imperial protection
being given to works printed and published&mdash;or in the case of works
of art, produced&mdash;within Newfoundland, on condition of registration
with the Colonial Secretary and deposit with him of two copies of a
printed work, bearing statutory copyright notice, or of the description of
a work of art,&mdash;which work must bear the signature of the
artist,&mdash;one of the two copies being for the use of the Legislative
Library.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="391a"></a>British West Indies, etc.</p>

<p>In the British West Indies, Jamaica has domestic legislation of 1887
under the Imperial act of 1886, for the British term, requiring the
deposit at an office notified in the Jamaica <i>Gazette</i> of three
copies within one month from publication&mdash;one for the British Museum,
one for official use, and one for a designated public library. The
Governor may declare one copy sufficient where deposit of three copies
would inflict injury. Trinidad, under an ordinance of 1888, provides
similarly for the deposit of three copies in the office of a Registrar of
copying rights, with optional but not obligatory registration of
playright. The minor British islands in the West Indies, the Bahamas,
British Guiana and British Honduras, seem not to have provided local
legislation, but remain exclusively under Imperial law.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="391b"></a>Australian code of 1905</p>

<p>The copyright act, 1905, of the Commonwealth of Australia, assented to
December 21, 1905, is a comprehensive code superseding previous copyright
legislation by the several states formerly separate colonies, New South
Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South <a name="Page_392"
id="Page_392"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 392]</span>Australia, Western
Australia and Tasmania, although it preserves the rights in existing
copyrights taken out under the several state acts. International
copyrights under acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom and state
copyrights may be registered under this act and then enforced throughout
the Commonwealth. This act covers (Part III) literary, musical and
dramatic copyright and separately (Part IV) artistic copyright. Part I,
preliminary, deals with definitions, and Part II with administration. Part
V deals with infringement, Part VI with international and state copyright,
Part VII with registration and Part VIII with miscellaneous provisions.
"The common law of England" is specifically applied to unpublished
literary compositions. The Australian code is of course concurrent though
not co-terminous with the Imperial law, and must be construed in
consonance with it. It is admitted that artistic works are not protected
in Australia under either Commonwealth or Imperial law unless "made in
Australia," and this serious difficulty the Commonwealth authorities
proposed to remedy by an amendatory act which was presented to the
Commonwealth legislature in 1906 but was not then passed. To prevent
importation of pirated works, written notice of the copyright and its term
should be given to the Minister in Australia unless communicated to him by
the Commissioners of Customs of the United Kingdom, from registry in
London, through the lists periodically distributed.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="392"></a>General provisions</p>

<p>Copyright in a book covers the right, directly or by authorization, to
copy, abridge, translate, dramatize or novelize, and in the case of a
musical work "to make any new adaptation, transposition, arrangement, or
setting of it, or of any part of it in any notation." "Copyright shall
subsist in every book" <a name="Page_393" id="Page_393"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 393]</span>(including by definition a dramatic or
musical work, when printed and published), "whether the author is a
British subject or not, which has been printed from type set up in
Australia, or plates made therefrom, or from plates or negatives made in
Australia, in cases where type is not necessarily used, and has ... been
published in Australia before or simultaneously" (defined as within
fourteen days) "with its first publication elsewhere"; and the copyright
term is forty-two years from first publication in Australia or the life of
the author or of the last surviving joint author and seven years
thereafter, whichever the longer. Performing right and lecturing right
subsist separately for a like period from first public performance or
delivery in Australia simultaneously with first public performance or
delivery elsewhere. But lecturing right ceases if a lecture is published
as a book. The author is the first owner of copyright or performing right,
except as employed for valuable consideration, and in the latter case may
reprint an article from a periodical after one year. Copyright subsists in
every artistic work "made in Australia," but the copyright of a portrait
or photograph is with the person ordering it.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="393a"></a>Dramatic and musical works</p>

<p>A dramatic work includes a libretto or lyrical work set to music or
otherwise, "or other scenic or dramatic composition"; a musical work is
defined as "any combination of melody and harmony, or either of them,
printed, reduced to writing or otherwise graphically produced or
reproduced"&mdash;which seems to omit mechanical reproductions.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="393b"></a>Performing right</p>

<p>Copyright is a distinct and separable property from performing right or
the ownership of an artistic work, and either right may be separately
assigned under any conditions or limitations. Where a dramatic or musical
work is published as a book, <a name="Page_394" id="Page_394"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 394]</span>notice of reservation of performing right
must be printed thereon, in default of which the owner of the performing
right cannot obtain damages from an infringer, but may obtain them from
the owner of the copyright who has neglected after notice to print such
reservation. The proprietor, tenant or occupier who permits a place to be
used for an infringing performance shall be deemed an infringer. The owner
of a performing right may himself issue notices in writing forbidding
performance, disregard of which involves a specified fine.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="394a"></a>Registration and license</p>

<p>Provision is made for a registrar and deputies, and for a general
Copyright Office where shall be kept separate registers of literary
copyrights, of fine art copyrights and of international and state
copyrights. The owner of any copyright, performing or lecturing right may
obtain registration by the deposit of two copies of the best edition of a
book or one copy of an art work or photograph of it, and no suit can be
maintained prior to such registration. In case, after the death of an
author, the owner of the copyright or performing right withholds the work
from the public, the Governor-General may grant a license for publication
or performance.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="394b"></a>New Zealand</p>

<p>New Zealand, now a separate self-governing dominion, provided when a
British colony,&mdash;like the Australian colonies before their
consolidation into the self-governing Commonwealth,&mdash;by an Ordinance
of 1842 for a copyright term of twenty-eight years or life, whichever the
longer, and has since passed special acts, covering specific classes, 1877
to 1903, but seemingly no general code. Photographs are protected for five
years from the taking. Telegraph dispatches were protected by the electric
lines act of 1884. Local registration seems to be provided only, and then
optionally, for the protection of plays, for which <a name="Page_395"
id="Page_395"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 395]</span>purpose application
with a copy of the play should be made at the Registry of Copyrights,
Wellington, and if the play is printed a copy deposited in the Library of
the General Assembly; and summary jurisdiction, with power of fine and
imprisonment, is then given to the magistrates. To prevent importation,
notice may be filed with the Minister of Customs in New Zealand, or
through the London commissioners, as in the case of Australia.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="395a"></a>Australasia otherwise</p>

<p>In the other British islands of Australasia and the Pacific, Imperial
copyright exclusively prevails, as a Fiji Islands' Ordinance of 1903, the
only one passed in any of the smaller islands, was disallowed by the
Crown.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="395b"></a>British India</p>

<p>British India provided a general copyright act in 1847, in line with
preceding Imperial legislation, and under the press copyright act of 1867,
somewhat modified the British Imperial law, especially providing for
deposit of three copies in an office to be designated from time to time in
the official gazette, within one month from publication, and the printing
on each copy of the printer's and publisher's names. Quarterly publication
of such titles is provided for as part of the official gazette. The
general term is as in Great Britain, for life and seven years or forty-two
years, whichever is longer, with variations for particular classes of
works. Ceylon, Mauritius and Hong Kong have the like term and also provide
for three deposit copies. In all these cases one copy is retained by the
Secretary of State of the colony, one put at the disposition of the
Governor and Council, and one after registration deposited in a designated
public library. Straits Settlement (Singapore) provides for registration
without deposit, in the office of Colonial Secretary. To prevent
importation into British India, specific notice may be filed directly with
<a name="Page_396" id="Page_396"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg

well as through the London customs.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="396"></a>South Africa</p>

<p>South Africa, the latest of the British self-governing dominions as
organized in 1910 into a Union, has not yet adopted a general copyright
code, which it may do under the precedent of Australia or after passage of
the new British copyright code, by acceptance of that code or by
independent legislation. Meantime its copyright relations are those of the
former separate colonies, as the Cape Colony, Natal and other English
colonies, following in the main English precedent, and the Transvaal and
other Dutch colonies, following Holland precedent, including a requirement
for printing within the country as a prerequisite for copyright.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Cape Colony</p>

<p>The Cape Colony, under acts of 1873, 1880, 1888 and 1895, provided
local copyright for life and five years or thirty years, whichever the
longer, four copies of a book or printed play first published in the
colony to be deposited for registration by the printer within one month
from delivery from the press, for registration with the Registrar of
Deeds, these copies to be transmitted to designated libraries. Telegraph
dispatches in newspapers were protected by the act of 1880, for 120 hours.
Lists of copyrighted works are printed in the government gazette and thus
communicated to the colonial customs authorities.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Natal</p>

<p>Natal, under acts of 1895, 1897 and 1898, provided local protection for
the regular British term, two copies to be deposited with the Colonial
Secretary for registration, within three months from publication. Messages
by telegraph, pigeons and other special dispatch were protected by the act
of 1895, for 72 hours. To protect a play, the title, if in manuscript, or
a printed copy, must be registered precedent to local action. Probably
failure to deposit in these colonies <a name="Page_397"
id="Page_397"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 397]</span>does not forfeit
copyright, and imperial provisions generally hold good.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Transvaal</p>

<p>The Transvaal, under local legislation of 1887, provided protection for
fifty years from registration, receipt or for life, on condition of
printing within the colony, and the deposit of three copies thus printed,
within two months of publication, accompanied by the affidavit of the
printer, without which formalities copyright was forfeited. A resolution
of 1895 authorized waiver of the printing requirement in the case of
countries having reciprocal relations. Reservation by printed notice was
required to protect playright and right of translation; playright in a
printed play was limited to ten years, but for an unpublished play was for
life and thirty years. All these colonies, whether formerly British or
Dutch, are probably now under Imperial copyright law, which would nullify
local provisions incompatible with that law, pending the enactment of a
South African general code.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="397a"></a>West coast colonies</p>

<p>Sierra Leone and the neighboring British colonies on the west coast, as
Gambia and the Gold Coast, are under imperial copyright law, and passed
local ordinances under the provisions of the British act of 1886, Sierra
Leone having provided by Ordinance of 1887 for copyright for the usual
British term with deposit of three copies in an office to be designated in
the Sierra Leone Royal <i>Gazette</i>, and the other colonies having
similar provisions.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="397b"></a>Mediterranean islands</p>

<p>The Mediterranean islands of Malta and Cyprus, in addition to imperial
copyright, have local ordinances providing respectively for registration
in an office notified in the government gazette, and deposit of three
copies, within one month from publication. Gibraltar seems to be only
under Imperial copyright.</p>

<h4>COPYRIGHT IN OTHER COUNTRIES</h4>

<p class="p2 sidenote"><a name="398"></a>France</p>

<p>France has always been the most liberal of countries in giving
copyright protection to foreign as well as native authors publishing
within France, and copyright was perpetual up to the abrogation by the
National Assembly in 1789 of all privileges previously granted. Though two
acts regarding dramatic performances (<i>spectacles</i>) were passed in
1791, it was not till 1793 that the National Convention passed a general
copyright act, which still remains the fundamental law of French
copyright. The state still has copyright in perpetuity in works published
by its order or by its agents, but not in private copyrights lapsing to
the state for lack of heirs; copyrights otherwise, by the law of 1866, are
for life and fifty years. Playright is protected without deposit, but the
printer of a book or play is required to deposit two copies on penalty of
fine but not forfeiture of copyright. No formalities are requisite, but to
obtain a right of action, deposit of two copies of a book is required, at
the Ministry of the Interior at Paris or at the Prefecture or town clerk's
office if in the provinces, for which a receipt is given. More than a
score of laws modifying the French copyright system have been passed, the
latest being that of April 9, 1910, providing that transfer of a work of
art does not involve the copyright.</p>

<p class="sidenote">French foreign relations</p>

<p>France, which had in general extended the protection of domestic
copyright to works published in France, whatever the nationality of the
author, specifically protected, by the decree of 1852, from <a
name="Page_399" id="Page_399"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
399]</span>republication (though not from performance) works published
abroad, without regard to reciprocity, on compliance with the formalities
of deposit previous to a suit for infringement. It early negotiated
treaties with other countries, only those with England (since replaced by
relations through the International Copyright Union) and Spain requiring
deposit in those countries, while four of the countries which required
registration permitted that it should be performed at their legations in
Paris.</p>

<p>France, as also its protectorate Tunis, became one of the original
signatory powers of the Berne convention of 1886, adopted the Paris acts
of 1896, and after some delay and discussion accepted the revised Berlin
convention under the act of June 28, 1910, ratified by decree of September
2, 1910, with reservation as to works of applied design, as to which it
maintained the stipulations of the previous conventions. It has treaties
with Austria-Hungary (1866-1884), Holland (1855-1884), Montenegro (1902),
Portugal (1866), and Roumania by an arrangement on the "most favored
nation" basis (1907). It has also still existing treaties with Germany
(1907), Italy (1884), and Spain (1880), among the unionist countries, on
the "most favored nation" basis&mdash;former treaties with Great Britain
and the Scandinavian countries having been superseded by International
Copyright Union relations. It has been in reciprocal relations with the
United States as a "proclaimed" country since July 1, 1891; and it has
also treaties with the Latin American countries of Argentina (1897), and
Paraguay (1900), both under the Montevideo convention, Bolivia (1887),
Costa Rica (1896), Ecuador on the "most favored nation" basis (1898,
1905), Guatemala (1895), Mexico through a treaty of commerce on the "most
favored nation" basis (1886), <a name="Page_400" id="Page_400"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 400]</span>and Salvador (1880), and one with Japan
(1909) as to rights in China. Algiers and other colonies are under French
law, and French precedent is followed by the protectorate Tunis, though as
a separate power.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="400a"></a>Belgium</p>

<p>Belgium, under the law of 1886, grants copyright and playright for life
and fifty years, including translations and photographs, or for corporate
and like works fifty years. No formalities are required except that
corporate and posthumous works must be registered at the Ministry of
Agriculture within six months from publication. Notice is required only to
forbid reproduction of newspaper articles. Belgium is one of the original
parties to the Berne convention, adopted the Paris acts and ratified on
May 23, 1910, the Berlin convention. It has treaties with Austria (1910),
Holland (1858), Portugal (1866), and Roumania (1910), as also with Germany
(1907) and Spain (1880)&mdash;all save Austria and Portugal on the "most
favored nation" basis; it has been in reciprocal relations with the United
States as a "proclaimed" country since July 1, 1891, and as to mechanical
music since June 14, 1911, and has also treaties with Mexico on the "most
favored nation" basis (1895), and under the Montevideo convention with
Argentina and Paraguay (1903).</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="400b"></a>Luxemburg</p>

<p>Luxemburg, under its law of 1898, very nearly a copy of the Belgian
law, grants copyright and playright for life and fifty years. The right to
translate is protected for ten years from the publication of the original
work. Registration is required only for posthumous or official works to be
made at the Office of the Government; and notice is required only to
reserve playright or to forbid reprint of newspaper articles. Protection
is provided against mechanical music reproductions. Luxemburg was an
acceding party to the Berne convention, accepted the Paris acts and <a
name="Page_401" id="Page_401"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
401]</span>ratified the Berlin convention July 14, 1910; it has had
reciprocal relations with the United States as a "proclaimed" country
since June 29, 1910, and as to mechanical music since June 14, 1911.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="401"></a>Holland</p>

<p>Holland, originally giving copyright in perpetuity under indefinite
conditions, and later applying French law, is now under its law of 1881,
the only country in Europe still requiring, in accordance with its ancient
practice, printing and publication within the country. Two copies, so
printed, must be deposited with the Department of Justice within a month
from publication, and playright must be reserved on a printed work. The
general term is for fifty years from the date of the certificate of
deposit and through the life of the author, if he has not assigned his
work, and for unprinted works, including oral addresses, life and thirty
years. The protection for unprinted works covers playright and the right
to translate, and protects any author domiciled within Holland or the
Dutch Indies. For corporate and like works, the term is fifty years. The
exclusive right to translate, must be reserved on the original work and
exercised within three years; the translation is then protected for five
years, provided it is printed within the country. Playright in a printed
play lasts only ten years from deposit. Holland is not a party to any
general convention, but it has a treaty with Belgium on the "most favored
nation" basis (1858) and arrangements with France (1855-1884); and it has
had reciprocal relations with the United States as a "proclaimed" country
since November 20, 1899. The Dutch colonies, as in the East and West
Indies and elsewhere, are generally included under Dutch law. A new
copyright code presented by the government in 1910, omitting the printing
requirement, has passed the first Chamber, and after it becomes <a
name="Page_402" id="Page_402"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 402]</span>law
Holland, under a concurrent vote in 1911, is authorized to accede to the
Berlin convention.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="402"></a>Germany</p>

<p>Copyright throughout the German Empire is now regulated for literary
(impliedly including dramatic) and musical works and certain
illustrations, by the act of 1901,&mdash;in which year there was also
adopted an act regulating publishers' rights and contracts; and for works
of figurative art and photographs by an act of 1907. An act of 1910 amends
these in some particulars.</p>

<p class="sidenote">History</p>

<p>These laws superseded entirely the previous acts, dating back to 1870,
when the first imperial copyright act was passed after the realization of
German unity under Emperor William I. The original act forming the
Germanic confederation in 1815, had authorized the German Diet to protect
authors' rights, and after futile decrees in 1832 and 1835, resolutions
were passed in 1837 making protection effective for a minimum period of
ten years throughout all the states which granted protection to authors.
Prussia had meanwhile, under the King's Order in Council of 1827, arranged
in 1827-29, reciprocal relations with thirty-three out of the thirty-eight
states and free cities in the German confederation, and with Denmark for
its German provinces, through which the citizens of other states enjoyed
the same privileges as natives; and in 1833 the same reciprocal provisions
were extended to cover Prussian provinces outside the federation. Many of
the early copyright systems had not extended protection to an author's
heirs, but in 1837 Prussia passed an improved law making the term life and
thirty years and granting protection to citizens of foreign countries in
the same proportion that works published in Prussia were therein
protected. Thus, up to the time of the Empire, copyright was protected as
a matter partly of federal and partly of state legislation. </p>

<p class="sidenote"> Laws of 1901-07</p>

<p><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
403]</span>Copyright under the imperial legislation of 1901-07 was granted
for life and thirty years, and furthermore for posthumous works at least
ten years from publication; and for anonymous, pseudonymous and corporate
works, thirty years. Copyright in photographs is for ten years only, and
in any event ceases ten years after the author's death. The copyright term
is reckoned from the end of the calendar year of an author's death or of
publication. In joint authorship, the term is from the death of the last
surviving author. Playright is, inferentially, under like terms and
conditions. The author of anonymous or pseudonymous works, on registering
his name, may obtain protection for the full term. In works published in
parts, the publication of the last part determines the copyright term.
Corporate bodies (juridical persons) are recognized as authors; in
composite works the originator of the work as a whole, or if no such
editor is mentioned, then the publisher, is regarded as author; if a
literary work is accompanied by music or by illustrations, the author of
each part is regarded as originator of his separate work; in inseparable
composite works, a partnership arrangement is recognized by the law. No
formalities are required, but registration of the author's name on its
disclosure in the case of an anonymous or pseudonymous book, may be made
in the register to be kept by the Municipal Council of Leipzig for a fee
of a mark and a half (36 cents) and expense of official publication
originally in the <i>Börsenblatt</i>, but since a law of 1903 in the
<i>Reichsanzeiger</i>. Translations, adaptations, etc., are protected as
original works. Official documents, public speeches, etc., are not
protected, and reproduction of newspaper articles, except those of a
scientific, technical or recreative character, is permitted, unless
reservation is made, on condition of <a name="Page_404"
id="Page_404"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 404]</span>acknowledgment and
that the meaning shall not be distorted. Extracts are permitted under
specified limitations. Poems may be used as set to music unless
distinctively intended for that purpose; and musical compositions, except
operas and the like, may be played for charity purposes or by musical
societies for members and their families.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Art provisions</p>

<p>In the case of a work of art, reproduction for personal use and
gratuitously is permitted, but during an author's life only by
photographic means; this permission authorizes only, as to a work of
architecture, reproduction of exterior aspect and not of the work upon the
ground. The person ordering a portrait is entitled to reproduce it, except
on agreement to the contrary. Reproduction and exhibition are permitted of
portraits in contemporary history or when accessories, as in a landscape
or part of a procession or assemblage, or in the interest of art if not
made to order,&mdash;provided this is not to the injury of the reputation
of the original; or in the interest of justice or public safety.
Reproductions of works standing permanently in public places are
permitted, but these may not be affixed to a work of architecture.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Piracy</p>

<p>Piracy is punished by damages and a statutory fine, or imprisonment in
case of intentional infringement, but proceedings must be commenced within
three years. The law provides for committees of experts in the several
states under regulations of the imperial government to act as arbiters or
to advise the justices; and there is final appeal to the Supreme Court of
the Empire.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Foreign citizens</p>

<p>The law protects all works of a subject of the German Empire and works
of aliens, if published within the Empire before previous publication
elsewhere, the latter clause a change from the former practice of
protecting works by a foreigner if published by a <a name="Page_405"
id="Page_405"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 405]</span>firm having a place
of business or a branch within the Empire.</p>

<p class="sidenote">German foreign relations</p>

<p>Germany was a party to the Berne convention and to the Paris acts, and
ratified July 12, 1910, the Berlin convention. This ratification was made
possible by an act of May 22, 1910, modifying domestic copyright to
conform with the provisions of the Berlin convention, and incidentally
repealing and replacing sec. 22 of the law of 1901, regarding mechanical
music reproduction, as fully stated in the chapter on that subject. On
July 12, 1910, the Emperor promulgated an ordinance providing for the
application of the law, and both the Berlin convention and this new law
became effective September 9, 1910.</p>

<p>Germany has treaties outside the Union with Austria-Hungary (1899), has
special treaties beyond the provisions of the Union on the "most favored
nation" basis, made in 1907 with Belgium, France, and Italy, and has been
a "proclaimed" country in reciprocal relations with the United States
since January 15, 1892. By proclamation of December 8, 1910, reciprocal
relations as to mechanical music reproductions were also proclaimed
between Germany and the United States.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="405"></a>Austria-Hungary</p>

<p>In Austria-Hungary, the dual states of that empire have separate
copyright as well as other legislative relations. Austrian domestic
copyright is based on the law of 1895, as amended by that of 1907, and
Hungarian on the law of 1884. Copyright in Austria is dependent on
publication within the country and citizenship or reciprocal relations; in
Hungary on publication by a Hungarian publisher and two years' residence
in the case of foreign authors whose country is not in reciprocal
relations. In Austria the general term is for life and thirty years, in
Hungary life and fifty years, or for corporate, anonymous and like <a
name="Page_406" id="Page_406"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
406]</span>works, thirty or fifty years respectively, unless the anonymous
author discloses his identity. Registration, in Austria at the Ministry of
Commerce, and in Hungary at the Ministry of Agriculture, is required only
for anonymous and pseudonymous works, and in Hungary in other special
cases, as plays. The right of translation must be reserved on the work,
for specified languages or in general, and must be exercised within stated
periods; notice is also required on photographs, and in Austria on musical
works to protect performing right. Posthumous works, if published in the
last five years of the thirty or fifty year term, are protected for five
years from publication. Photographs are protected only for ten years in
Austria and five years in Hungary. Collections of telegraph news, as
printed in a newspaper, are protected in Hungary. Austria and Hungary have
a treaty with each other (1907), and jointly with Great Britain (1893),
Germany (1899), France (1866-1884) and Italy (1890), involving in the case
of Hungary registration in Hungary as well as in the country of origin.
Austria has also treaties with Belgium (1910), Denmark (1907), Roumania
(1908), and Sweden (1908), and has been in reciprocal relations with the
United States as a "proclaimed" country since December 9, 1907; Hungary is
negotiating reciprocal relations with the United States, but has otherwise
no separate treaties. Neither Austria nor Hungary is a unionist
country.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="406"></a>Switzerland</p>

<p>Switzerland, under its federal constitution of 1874 and the law of
1883, provided copyright for life and thirty years or for corporate and
like works thirty years, giving protection for the full term to
translations if the right to translate is exercised within five years from
publication. Photographs were protected for five years only. No
formalities are required, though an author has the option of registering
his <a name="Page_407" id="Page_407"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
407]</span>work, with the exception that registration in the Office of
Intellectual Property is required within three months from publication for
the protection of posthumous and official publications and photographs.
Notice of reservation of playright is required on printed copies.
Switzerland was an original party to the Berne convention, accepted the
Paris acts and ratified the Berlin convention without reservation in 1910.
It has had reciprocal relations with the United States as a "proclaimed"
country since July 1, 1891, and included copyright in a treaty with
Colombia (1908).</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="407"></a>Scandinavian countries</p>

<p>The Scandinavian countries, Denmark, Norway and Sweden, in which last
copyright was formerly perpetual, now grant protection for life and fifty
years as the general term, or fifty years for corporate and like works, an
anonymous author having the right to the full term on printing his name in
a new edition or declaring it by registration. Photographs are protected
for five years&mdash;in Norway for fifteen years. The right to translate
into a Scandinavian language is protected for the full term; into other
languages for the full term in Norway, but in Denmark and Sweden only for
ten years from the end of the year of publication of the original work,
with an addition in Denmark that a translation published within these ten
years protects the author for the full term against unauthorized
translation into that language. No formalities are requisite, but in
Norway the printer is required, though default does not affect copyright,
to deposit a copy with the university library in Christiania within a year
of publication. Notice is required, however, on photographs, and except in
Sweden, to reserve right of musical performance. Denmark, by two laws of
1911, requires deposit and registration of photographs. Sweden makes the
exceptions that works of art are protected for life <a name="Page_408"
id="Page_408"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 408]</span>and ten years and
that playright is for life and thirty years, or for anonymous plays, only
for five years, unless the author meantime discloses his identity. In
Denmark and Norway right of recitation and in Sweden playright must be
specifically reserved.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Scandinavian foreign relations</p>

<p>Denmark's domestic copyright is covered by laws of 1865, 1902, 1904,
1908 and 1911, Norway's by those of 1877, 1882, 1893, 1909 and 1910,
Sweden's by the general laws of 1897, codifying those of 1877, etc.,
respectively for literary, art and photographic works, and amendatory acts
of 1904 and 1908. All three are unionist countries. Denmark remains under
the Berne-Paris agreement, not having accepted the Berlin convention.
Norway became party to the Berlin convention by ratification September 4,
1910, with reservations as to architectural works, in which it adheres to
article IV of the Berne convention; as to newspaper and review articles,
in which it adheres to article VII of the Berne convention; and as to the
retroactive provision, in which it adheres to article XIV of the Berne
convention. Sweden remains under the Berne convention and the
interpretative declaration of Paris, not having accepted either the Paris
additional act or the Berlin convention. Each Scandinavian country has a
special copyright treaty with the other two (1877, 1879, 1881). Denmark
has also a treaty with Austria (1907) and Sweden with Austria (1908).
Denmark has had reciprocal relations with the United States as a
"proclaimed" country since May 8, 1893, Norway since May 25, 1905, and as
to mechanical music since June 14, 1911, and Sweden since June 1, 1911. A
special law for Iceland, embodying in general the Danish provisions, was
passed in 1905, and the Danish law may be taken as covering the other
Danish colonies, as the Danish West Indies, in lack of special
legislation. </p>

<p><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
409]</span>Russia early gave, in 1828-30, enlightened protection to
authors, providing for a term of life and twenty-five years, with an added
ten years under specified circumstances, and protecting an author's
copyright from seizure by his creditors and from passing from a bankrupt
publisher except on fulfillment of the author's contract. Under the civil
code of 1887, copyright was extended to life and fifty years, but
playright was only nominally protected and the protection of translations
was negatived by a decision that translations must be word for word. The
new law sanctioned March 20, 1911, is a comprehensive and detailed code
providing copyright for life and fifty years, except that certain
collections are only protected for life and twenty-five years and
periodicals for twenty-five years, photographs for ten years and
translations on notice of reservation for ten years, the right to
translate being exercised within five years from publication. Playright is
protected, but on a musical work notice of protection must be printed. A
photograph must bear notice of its purpose, date and author's name and
domicile. Protection is accorded to all works published in Russia and
works published by Russian subjects domiciled elsewhere; and provision is
made for treaties on reciprocal conditions. The law treats also of
relations between authors and publishers. Russia, though represented at
Berlin, has as yet no international relations.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="409b"></a>Finland</p>

<p>Finland, formerly an independent grand duchy, protects copyright under
its law of 1880 for a general term of life and fifty years, with
exceptions as to photographs, etc., and with provisions as to translation
into the Finnish and Scandinavian languages similar to those of
Scandinavian countries. Other provisions are similar to those of Russia.
It has no exterior copyright relations. </p>

<p><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
410]</span>Spain passed a general copyright code in 1879, which applied
not only to the Peninsula, but <i>ultramar</i> to Cuba and the other
colonies, and became a model for later legislation in several
Spanish-American countries, under which code detailed regulations were
promulgated in 1880. This code is enforced through the penal code of 1870
and the civil code of 1889. Ordinances from 1893 to 1910 deal with the
regulations as to details. Spain grants copyright for life and eighty
years on condition of registration by deposit of three signed copies with
the Register of Intellectual Property in the Ministry of Agriculture, or
in the provincial centres for registration, within one year from
publication. In default of registry within the year, any one may publish
the work for ten years; and if after the ten years the author fails to
register within the ensuing (twelfth) year, the work falls into the public
domain. Protection is given for an indefinite term to works issued by the
state and, to the extent of their legal existence, those from corporate
bodies. A work assigned within the life of the author, remains in the
possession of the assignee during the full term unless there are natural
heirs (<i>herederos forzosos</i>&mdash;"forced" or inalienable heirs), in
which case the right reverts to such heirs twenty-five years after the
death of the author, on registry of such right and proof of succession
under the regulations accompanying the act. This, according to the
official Spanish print, is for the remaining fifty-five years&mdash;not,
as in a French version, for twenty-five years only. A musical work is
protected with reference to other instruments and to other forms in a
provision so broad that it is possibly applicable to mechanical music
reproductions. Writings and telegrams inserted in periodicals may be
reproduced unless this is expressly forbidden by notice at the title or at
the end of the <a name="Page_411" id="Page_411"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 411]</span>article&mdash;a provision which implies the
protection of articles and telegrams in case of such notice of
reservation. Works not republished for twenty years fall into the public
domain, except in the case of unprinted dramatic or musical
works,&mdash;unless the proprietor shows that during such period he has
kept copies on sale. The protection of domestic law is extended by the
terms of the law to citizens of countries having reciprocal relations,
without additional formalities.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Spanish foreign relations</p>

<p>Spain was one of the original parties to the Berne convention, accepted
the Paris acts and adopted the Berlin convention without reservation,
through ratification by the King September 5, 1910. Spain has treaties
with Portugal as well as with Belgium, France and Italy, all four made in
1880 on the "most favored nation" basis; it has relations with the United
States under treaties of 1895, 1898 (the peace treaty), and 1902, and as a
"proclaimed" country since July 10, 1895; and has treaties also with
Colombia (1885), Costa Rica (1893), Ecuador (1900), Guatemala (1893),
Mexico (1903) and Salvador (1884), mostly on the "most favored nation"
basis, and relations under the Montevideo convention with Argentina and
Paraguay (1900).</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="411"></a>Portugal</p>

<p>Portugal, under its civil code of 1867 and penal code of 1886, grants
copyright for life and fifty years to its citizens and to foreigners whose
countries grant reciprocal relations. The foreign author, to protect a
translation of his work, which protection is for ten years only, must
provide such translation within three years. Translations of non-copyright
works by a native translator are protected for thirty years. Two copies
must be deposited before publication at the Public Library, or in the case
of dramatic and musical publication in the Royal Conservatory in Lisbon.
Portugal as a republic acceded to the Berlin convention <a name="Page_412"
id="Page_412"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 412]</span>from March 29,
1911. It has additional relations with Italy (1906) and Spain on the "most
favored nation" basis (1880); and reciprocal relations with the United
States as a "proclaimed" country since July 20, 1893, and with Brazil
(1889).</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="412"></a>Italy</p>

<p>Italy grants copyright under its law of 1882,&mdash;codifying its
original law of 1865 and the dramatic law of 1875,&mdash;as promulgated by
royal decree September 19, 1882, to become effective in 1885, and its
civil code of 1889. It assures full copyright for life or forty years,
whichever the longer. After forty years from first publication or, if the
author live beyond that date, after his death, a second term of forty
years begins, in which any person, on duly declaring his intention, may
republish a work, on condition of paying five per cent royalty to the
copyright proprietor. The state may expropriate any work after the death
of an author on paying to the proprietor a compensation named by three
experts. Government and society publications are copyright only for twenty
years. An author may reserve rights of translation for ten years.
Playright is for eighty years. Three copies of the printed work should be
deposited at the prefecture of the province within three months, in
default of which, infringement previous to deposit cannot be punished; and
if deposit is not made within ten years, the author is understood to waive
his rights. With the deposit copy a declaration of reservation of rights
should be filed, for publication in a semi-annual list in the official
gazette. Notice is required to reserve rights in periodical
contributions. A manuscript copy of an unpublished play should be
submitted within three months from first performance for <i>visé</i>,
which manuscript is then returned. By the law of 1910, as to legal
deposit, three copies must be delivered to the <i>Procureur du Roi</i> in
the district <a name="Page_413" id="Page_413"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 413]</span>of the printing establishment for
transmission to the official libraries in Florence, Rome and the
respective province; failure to make such deposit does not affect the
copyright, but involves a fine. The laws, both of 1865 and 1882, extended
copyright to foreign works, on relations of reciprocity, without treaty
arrangements and without additional formalities.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Italian foreign relations</p>

<p>Italy was an original party to the Berne convention and accepted the
Paris acts, but has yet to ratify the Berlin convention. It has treaties
with Austria-Hungary (1890), Montenegro (1900), Portugal (1906), Roumania
(1906), San Marino (1897); also special treaties with Spain (1880), France
(1884), and Germany (1907), all on the "most favored nation" basis. It has
had reciprocal relations with the United States as a "proclaimed" country
since October 28, 1892, and has also treaties with Colombia (1892), with
Cuba (1903) and Mexico (1890) on the "most favored nation" basis, and with
Nicaragua (1906); and also under the Montevideo convention, relations with
Argentina and Paraguay (1900).</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="413a"></a>San Marino</p>

<p>San Marino, the tiny state enclosed within Italy, has pledged itself by
the copyright provisions in its treaty with Italy (1897) to protect all
works protected in Italy, by application of the Italian law.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="413b"></a>Monaco</p>

<p>Monaco, under laws of 1889 and 1896, provides copyright for life and
fifty years with the peculiar provision that copyright on anonymous and
pseudonymous works extends fifty years beyond the death of the publisher,
who is reputed author. No formalities are required except notice of
reservation in respect to articles in periodicals. Monaco acceded to the
Berne convention, in 1889, accepted the Paris acts and ratified the Berlin
convention without reservation, December 19, 1910. </p>

<p class="sidenote"> <a name="414a"></a>Greece</p>

<p><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
414]</span>Greece originally provided for copyright protection under its
penal code of 1833, with a term of fifteen years subject to royal
extension. By the law of 1867 the printer of a work was required to
deposit with the National Library two copies within ten days of
publication, failure involving a fine of at least ten drachmas, but not
forfeiture of copyright; and to this requirement was added by the law of
1910 a third copy for the Library of Parliament and a fourth for the local
public library, with authority to transmit through the post. A dramatic
copyright law of 1909 specifically covers playright, making the term life
and forty years and preventing modification of a play by an assignee.
Greece has no international relations.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="414b"></a>Montenegro</p>

<p>Montenegro, though it has no specific domestic copyright law, and only
gives uncertain protection under its customary law and civil code of 1888,
has treaties with France (1902) and Italy (1900). It had acceded to the
Berne convention July 1, 1893, and accepted the Paris acts, but withdrew
from the International Copyright Union April 1, 1900, "from motives of
economy."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="414c"></a>Roumania and other Balkan
states</p>

<p>The Balkan states are led in copyright protection by Roumania, possibly
owing to the influence of the literary queen "Carmen Sylva," which
country, under the press law of 1862 and penal code of 1864, has protected
copyright and playright, including probably translation, for life and ten
years. Written registration is required at the Ministry of Instruction,
and deposit of four copies was also required, though not on penalty of
forfeiture of copyright. A later law, of 1904, repeals the deposit
requirement. Roumania has copyright treaties with Belgium (1910), France
(1907), these on the "most favored nation" basis, Austria (1908) and Italy
(1906). Bulgaria and Servia seem to give no protection, except that
accorded in Bulgaria <a name="Page_415" id="Page_415"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 415]</span>by its penal code of 1896, and have no
international relations.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="415a"></a>Turkey</p>

<p>Turkey, which gave some protection to authors so far back as its penal
code of 1857, passed in 1910 a new copyright code providing for books,
drama and music a term of life and thirty years, in which last the
children, widow or widower, the parents and the grandchildren or their
descendants should benefit in equal shares; and for works of art,
including architecture, a term of life and eighteen years. Posthumous
works are protected from publication for the years above stated. Copyright
includes right of translation, representation and adaptation; translations
are protected, but the term extends only fifteen years after the death of
the translator. The assignment of publishing right does not include
playright unless specifically stated. Reprint of periodical articles,
unless forbidden, and extracts from books "in case of urgency or to the
end of public utility," may be made on acknowledgment of the source.
Reprint of works out of print may be licensed by the Ministry of Public
Instruction. Registration is requisite with deposit of three copies, in
the case of reproduced works, with the Ministry of Public Instruction, at
Constantinople, or in its provincial offices on written application and a
fee of a quarter of a Turkish pound, for which a certificate is issued. An
annual publication of the copyright entries is provided for. The law is
not in terms confined to Turkish subjects, but it may by the nature of
Turkish legislation apply only within the Turkish Empire, though there
seems to be hope that Turkey may adhere to the Berlin convention. Turkey
is otherwise without international relations.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="415b"></a>Japan</p>

<p>Japan, the only oriental power which is a unionist country, adopted a
general copyright code in 1899 (March 3, as applied by ordinances of June
27 and <a name="Page_416" id="Page_416"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
416]</span>28), modifying a law of 1877, and in the same year (July 15)
ratified the Berne-Paris agreements and became a member of the
International Copyright Union. Amendatory acts were adopted in 1910, on
June 14-15, broadening the scope to include architecture and providing as
to details of registration. Under domestic legislation first publication
in Japan is the only requisite for copyright, but registration must be
made in the Ministry of the Interior before action for infringement can be
brought, and by disclosure of name to obtain the full term for anonymous
and pseudonymous works. Registrations are printed in the official gazette.
Protection is for life and thirty years, or thirty years for anonymous,
posthumous and corporate works. The right of translation is protected for
ten years, and translations are protected for the full term; photographs
for ten years only. Titles are protected in copyrighted works, but not
general titles. Periodical contributions must be protected by notice.
Japan accepted the convention of Berlin with reservations as to the
exclusive right of translation, in which it adheres to Article V of the
Berne convention as revised at Paris, and as to the public performance of
musical works, in which it adheres to Article IX of the Berne convention.
Japan has treaties with China (1903) and with the United States (November
10, 1905, "proclaimed" May 17, 1906), which, however, excepts
translations, and also special treaties of August 11, 1908, covering
Japanese protectorates in Korea and China.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="416"></a>Korea</p>

<p>Korea was formerly without copyright provisions, except as given by the
above-named treaty and similar British provisions as to the consular court
at Seoul, but since it has become practically a Japanese possession, it
has been included by Japanese ordinance of 1908 under Japanese copyright
law. </p>

<p class="sidenote"> <a name="417a"></a>China</p>

<p><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
417]</span>China promulgated, December 18, 1910, its first domestic
copyright provisions, establishing a term of life and thirty years, on
condition of registration by deposit of two copies at the Ministry of the
Interior or corresponding provincial office, with a fee of five dollars.
The protection does not include the exclusive right to translate foreign
works into the Chinese language, although individual translations may be
protected. Photographs, unless included in writings, are protected only
for ten years from date of registration. These provisions require approval
to be made effective. China has a treaty with Japan (1903) and one of like
date (October 8, 1903) with the United States, effective from January 13,
1904, protecting for ten years books, maps, prints, or engravings,
"especially prepared for the use and education of the Chinese people" or
"translation into Chinese of any book," but Chinese subjects are to have
liberty to make "original translations into Chinese," so that the treaty
affords little protection. By treaty with Japan (August 11, 1908) Japan's
copyright protection is extended where it has extraterritorial
jurisdiction, as in Canton and other places in China. By British Orders in
Council of 1899, 1907, copyright protection against infringement by a
British subject may be afforded by the consular court at Shanghai to
foreign as well as British suitors under specified conditions.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="417b"></a>Siam</p>

<p>Siam passed a literary copyright law in 1901, giving identical rights
with those in any other property for life and seven years, or for
forty-two years, whichever the longer, on the conditions of printing and
publication within the country, registration within a year and deposit of
four copies. Siam has no treaty relations, but works printed and first
published there possibly would have the benefit of the law. British
copyright protection is also extended through British consulates. </p>

<p><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg

copyright protection, although Persia was represented at the Berlin
conference. Copyright provisions in British India, Ceylon and the other
Asian colonies is covered in the preceding chapter on the British
dominions. The Dutch East Indies have copyright protection under Dutch
law, and Indo-China under French law. The Philippine Islands, like the
Sandwich Islands (Hawaii), have copyright protection under United States
law.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="418b"></a>Tunis, etc.</p>

<p>Tunis, a protectorate of France but not a French colony, long the only
unionist country in Africa, has domestic protection under its law of 1889,
following in general that of France, with a term of life and fifty years.
It was one of the original parties, as a separate power, to the treaty of
Berne, accepted the Paris acts and ratified the Berlin convention with
reservation, September 30, 1910, like France, as to works of applied
design, in which it adheres to the stipulations of the previous
convention; it has no other foreign relations. Algiers, a French colony,
is under French law and international relations. Morocco and other native
states seem to be without copyright protection.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="418c"></a>Egypt</p>

<p>Egypt, under the protectorate of Great Britain but not a British
possession technically, is without domestic legislation, except that its
penal code of 1884-89 forbids piracy, and it is not included under British
relations. But under a crude sort of customary law and this penal code,
the courts enforce rights of foreigners as well as of natives by the
protection of their works for an indefinite term. The rights of French
citizens in plays and music have been enforced through the French consular
court, and in recent years the mixed courts at Cairo and the Court of
Appeal have exercised copyright jurisdiction, "under the principles of
natural justice and the laws of <a name="Page_419" id="Page_419"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 419]</span>equity." In the leading case of the Société
des gens de lettres <i>v.</i> Egyptian Gazette, in 1889, the Court of
Appeal laid down the principle that "copyright is a veritable right of
property founded on labor," and on this ground has upheld the right of
literary, dramatic and musical authors and of artists to prevent
reproduction.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="419a"></a>Liberia</p>

<p>Liberia seems to have no domestic copyright law recorded, and probably
protection, national and international, is under customary law without
formalities. It was represented as an independent power at the Berne
convention and signed the original convention, but never became a party to
it by ratification; it, however, adopted the Berlin convention by
ratification and is now a member of the International Copyright Union.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="419b"></a>Africa otherwise</p>

<p>The Congo Free State seems to cover copyright offenses by its
extradition treaties with Belgium (1898) and France (1899) to the extent
of including in the list of offenses fraudulent application to any art
object or work of literature or music, of the name of an author, or any
distinctive sign adopted by him.</p>

<p>Copyright provision in South Africa, Sierra Leone and other British
colonies is covered in the preceding chapter on the British dominions.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="419c"></a>Latin America</p>

<p>In Latin America provision for copyright protection had generally been
made by the several states, for various terms, in some cases in
perpetuity, previous to a movement for international relationship which
began with the Montevideo convention of 1889, for South American states
only, reached a further step in the convention of Mexico City, 1902, was
not substantially advanced by the amendatory treaty proposed at Rio de
Janeiro, 1906, which never became practically operative anywhere, and
culminated in the Buenos Aires convention of 1910, which <a
name="Page_420" id="Page_420"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 420]</span>was
ratified by the United States Senate February 16, 1911, but has yet to be
ratified by the Latin countries. Five South American states are bound
together under the Montevideo convention as ratified by Argentina (1894),
Bolivia (1903), Paraguay (1889), Peru (1889), and Uruguay (1892).</p>

<p>The United States has relations with Mexico (1896), Costa Rica (1899),
Cuba (1903), Chile (1896), and by ratification in 1908 of the Mexico
convention of 1902, with Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua,
Salvador and possibly Dominican Republic, and will come into relations
under the Buenos Aires convention of 1910, with any power ratifying that
convention.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="420"></a>Mexico</p>

<p>Mexico, under the guarantees of property in its constitution of 1857,
and the specific and elaborate copyright provisions of its civil code of
1871, as modified by that of 1884, grants copyright in perpetuity and
playright for life and thirty years as the general term, with complicated
modifications and exceptions. In the case of anonymous and pseudonymous
works, rights in perpetuity are to the publisher and his successors,
pending disclosure of the author, who must record his name in a sealed
envelope. The right of translation is protected in perpetuity except for
works of non-residents published abroad, then limited to ten years.
Corporate works are protected for twenty-five and official publications
for ten years only. Registration is required through application to the
Minister of Public Education and deposit of two copies is obligatory, one
in the National Library and one in the Public Archives. A third copy is
usually expected for the Library of the Ministry. The right to copyright
holds for ten years from publication. Reservation is required of right of
translation and of other specified rights, by notice on the printed work.
Protection is conditioned on residence, reciprocity or first publication
<a name="Page_421" id="Page_421"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
421]</span>within Mexico. Private letters may not be published without
consent of both correspondents or their heirs, except for proof of right
or in the public interest, or for the progress of science. Mexico does not
seem to be a party to any convention, not even that of Mexico City, but
has had reciprocal relations with the United States as a "proclaimed"
country since February 27, 1896, and has treaties with the Dominican
Republic (1890) and Ecuador (1888), and with Belgium (1895), France
(1886), Italy (1890), and Spain (1903), all on the "most favored nation"
basis. To obtain Mexican copyright, it seems necessary to execute a power
of attorney, validated by a Mexican consul, to a representative in Mexico
City for the registration and deposit at the Ministry.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="421"></a>Central American states: Costa

<p>Of the five nations of Central America, Costa Rica, under penal and
civil codes of 1880 and 1888 and a copyright law of 1896, grants
copyright, including playright, for life and fifty years, with provisions
for return to heirs after twenty years and other variations after the
Spanish model, on registration and deposit within a year of three copies
of a printed work at the office of Public Libraries, on condition of
residence or reciprocity. Guatemala, under a decree of 1879, grants
copyright for literary works in perpetuity on registration and deposit of
four copies at the Ministry of Public Education to "inhabitants of the
Republic,"&mdash;with the curious provision that an assignee cannot
prevent republication with "essential modifications" by the author. Right
of translation must be reserved by notice. A sealed envelope with name of
author must accompany an anonymous book. Honduras, under its constitution
of 1894, has provisions in its civil and penal codes of 1898 guaranteeing
to an author of a literary, scientific or artistic work the general
property rights, pending passage of a copyright <a name="Page_422"
id="Page_422"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 422]</span>law and punishing
fraud by "minor banishment." Nicaragua, under its civil code of 1904,
grants copyright in perpetuity on registration and deposit of six copies
with the Ministry of Agriculture. Right of translation must be reserved by
notice. Salvador, under its constitution of 1886 and law of 1900, grants
copyright on works published in Salvador for life and twenty-five years,
or for corporate works fifty years from publication on deposit of one copy
with the Minister of Agriculture before publication, with the exceptional
provision that if the heirs renounce their rights or fail to make use of
them within a year from the author's death, the work falls into the public
domain; the translator of a Latin or Greek work is protected as an author,
and the government may grant five-year licenses for the reprint with
author's permission of "interesting works," presumably those published
elsewhere.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="422"></a>Interstate and international
relations</p>

<p>In 1894-95, and again in 1897-1901, interstate treaties, incidentally
covering copyright, were negotiated; but interstate and international
relations are now covered by the participation of the five nations, as
well as the United States and the Dominican Republic, in the Mexico
convention of 1902 and by the treaty of peace made by these five Central
American states at Washington, December 20, 1907. There is some question
under the treaty of 1907 whether protection is assured in each state to
others than residents, but probably all citizens of the five states are
protected throughout all. To secure protection under the convention of
1902, an American citizen should apply for an additional certificate from
the U.&nbsp;S. Copyright Office for each country, which after validation
by the State Department is sent with one deposit copy for each country to
the respective American legations, through which official acknowledgment
will be returned. <a name="Page_423" id="Page_423"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 423]</span>Costa Rica has had reciprocal relations
with the United States as a "proclaimed" country since October 19, 1899,
and has treaties with France (1896) and Spain (1893); Guatemala with
France (1895) and Spain (1893), the latter on the "most favored nation"
basis; Nicaragua with Italy (1906); and Salvador with France (1880) and
Spain (1884).</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="423a"></a>Panama</p>

<p>Panama grants copyright under the constitution of 1904, which adopted
and made part of Panamanian law the Colombian copyright law of 1886, which
is summarized in the paragraph on Colombia. The Canal Zone is under United
States law through a War Department order of 1907.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="423b"></a>Cuba</p>

<p>Cuba, which as a Spanish colony came under the Spanish act of 1879, has
domestic protection under this act as applied by four military ordinances,
1900-1902, during the United States protectorate, and continued under its
insular government. In the third ordinance, of June 13, 1901, it was
provided that existing copyrights under the Spanish law of 1879 should be
valid during their term, and also that copyright as well as patents
granted by the United States shall have insular protection on deposit of a
copy of the certificate. Registration is made at the Registry in the
Department of State within one year of publication, accompanied, if a
foreign work, by certificate of copyright in the country of origin, and
deposit should be made of three copies for preservation in the National
Library, the University and the Public Archives. On these conditions,
under the military ordinance of 1900, authors of foreign scientific,
artistic and literary works or their agents or representatives enjoy
protection in the case of new works. Regulations of 1909 prescribe the
forms of application for domestic and for foreign works. To claim Cuban
copyright, an American should obtain an attested copy of the <a
name="Page_424" id="Page_424"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
424]</span>copyright certificate and transmit this, with a power of
attorney in Spanish validated by a Cuban consul, and three deposit copies,
to a representative in Havana, who must deposit the certificate with an
attested Spanish translation and the three copies at the Registry.
Copyrights by Spanish subjects previous to the treaty of peace with the
United States, ratified in 1899, remain valid by virtue of a specific
article in the treaty. Cuba has been in reciprocal relations with the
United States as a "proclaimed" country since November 17, 1903, and has a
treaty with Italy (1903) on the "most favored nation" basis. It is reputed
to have ratified the Pan American convention of 1902, but possibly only
the industrial treaty.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="424a"></a>Haiti</p>

<p>Haiti, which gave copyright protection as early as 1835, adopted in
1885 a copyright law with some unusual features. An author holds exclusive
right during life; the widow through her life; the children for twenty
years further, or other heirs, if there are no children surviving, for ten
years. Unauthorized reprints are confiscated on the complaint of the
proprietor of the copyright; and the author recovers from the reprinter
the price of a thousand, or from a bookseller of two hundred copies,
reckoned at the retail price of the author's edition. Deposit is required
of five copies within twelve months from publication at the Department of
the Interior. Haiti has the unique distinction in Latin America of being a
unionist country; it was originally a party to the Berne convention,
accepted the Paris acts and adopted the Berlin convention without
reservation. It has no relations with the United States and no
treaties.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="424b"></a>Dominican Republic</p>

<p>The Dominican Republic provides copyright protection under its
constitution of 1896, has a treaty with Mexico (1890) on the "most favored
nation" basis, and ratified the Pan American convention <a name="Page_425"
id="Page_425"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 425]</span>(though possibly
only the industrial treaty) of 1902, June 15, 1907.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="425a"></a>West Indian Colonies</p>

<p>Jamaica and the other British islands and colonies along the Atlantic
and Caribbean seas have copyright protection under imperial and to some
extent local laws, as already noted; Porto Rico is under the provisions of
United States law and the Danish and Dutch West Indian colonies are under
the respective laws of their nations.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="425b"></a>Brazil</p>

<p>Brazil, under the constitution of 1891 and the law of 1898 and
regulations of 1901, grants copyright for the general term, inclusive of
photographs, of fifty years from the first of January of the year of
publication, with a term of ten years for the right of translation and
playright. Posthumous works are protected within fifty years from the
death of the author. Assignments are valid only for thirty years, after
which copyright reverts to the author. Written application for
registration is requisite at the National Library, and deposit of one copy
of a printed book or play must be made there within two years. Reservation
of royalty for playright must be made on a printed work. Protection is
confined to a native or resident or a Portuguese author of a work written
in Portuguese&mdash;the latter in accordance with a treaty of reciprocity
with Portugal (1889), the only treaty.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="425c"></a>Argentina</p>

<p>Argentina, which under its constitution of 1853 and civil code of 1869
protected an author's productions as general property, adopted in
September, 1910, a copyright law, as an application of common law,
providing for a term of life and ten years, or in the case of posthumous
works twenty years from publication. Protection is comprehensive of all
classes of intellectual property, and extends to all forms of use without
special reservation. By Presidential decree of February 4, 1911, a Section
of Library deposit was <a name="Page_426" id="Page_426"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 426]</span>established as a division of the National
Library. Registration is required by deposit of two printed copies or of
an identifying reproduction within fifteen days from publication for works
published in the capital, or thirty days in the provinces, this including
foreign works published within the country, publication meaning the
offering for sale therein. The law specifically applies to authors of
other countries with which Argentina has international relations, deposit
in Buenos Aires being then not required where the formalities of the
country of origin have been fulfilled. Argentina's international relations
are dependent chiefly on the Montevideo convention of 1889, as ratified by
Argentina with respect to Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay in 1894, Bolivia in
1903, and with respect to Belgium in 1903, France in 1896, Italy and Spain
in 1900.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="426"></a>Paraguay and Uruguay</p>

<p>Paraguay and Uruguay, like Argentina, long protected intellectual
property as general property. Paraguay's constitution of 1870 secures
exclusive property to an author, and a new penal code, promulgated in
1910, assures copyright on all classes of intellectual property, on
registration in the public registries with prescribed fees, and punishes
piracy by fine of double the profit and imprisonment. Uruguay in its civil
code of 1868 declared that the productions of talent or intellect are the
property of their authors, to be regulated by special law, but no such law
has been passed. Both countries have relations with the other South
American states parties to the Montevideo convention of 1889; Paraguay has
also the same relations as Argentina with the European countries above
cited. The statement that Paraguay is a party to the Mexico City
convention of 1902 seems a misapprehension arising from the fact that her
representative signed <i>ad referendum</i>. </p>

<p><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
427]</span>Chile, under the constitution of 1833 and law of 1834 and its
civil code of 1855 and penal code of 1874, protects copyright including
playright for a general term of life and five years thereafter, which may
be extended an additional five years, except for playright, by action of
the government, corporate works for forty and posthumous works for ten
years. Deposit of three copies is required at the National Library in
Santiago. Protection is extended to foreign works [first?] published in
Chile; a Chilean-made edition of a work already published abroad may have
protection for ten years. Chile has reciprocal relations with the United
States as a "proclaimed" country since May 25, 1896; by a provision in the
treaty respecting parcels post, piratical copies of works copyright in the
country of destination are to be excluded. Chile ratified only the
ineffective Rio convention of 1906.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="427b"></a>Peru</p>

<p>Peru, under its law of 1849 and the constitution of 1860 and penal
code, grants copyright including playright for life and twenty years
thereafter. Anonymous and pseudonymous works may be protected for the full
term by deposit of the true name in a sealed envelope. Posthumous works
are protected for thirty years. Deposit is required of one copy in the
public library and one copy in the department Prefecture. Protection is
probably confined to an inhabitant of Peru, but Peru has reciprocal
relations under the Montevideo convention as ratified October 25, 1889,
with Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="427c"></a>Bolivia</p>

<p>Bolivia, which protected intellectual property by its penal code of
1834, and later by a copyright law of 1879, adopted a brief copyright
code, including playright, in 1909, providing a general term of life and
thirty years, with the peculiar provision that the publisher of a work of
unrecognized authorship <a name="Page_428" id="Page_428"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 428]</span>hitherto unpublished may have protection
for twenty years. Registration is required at the Ministry of Public
Education and deposit of one copy of printed works must be made within one
year of publication in the public libraries, in default of which the work
falls into the public domain. Bolivia has reciprocal relations under the
Montevideo convention as ratified November 5, 1903, with Argentina,
Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay, and also international arrangements with
France (1887).</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="428"></a>Ecuador</p>

<p>Ecuador, under the constitution of 1884 and law of 1887, grants
copyright for life and fifty years, and playright for life and twenty-five
years. Anonymous and pseudonymous works are protected fifty years beyond
the death of the publisher, unless the author meantime substitutes his
name; posthumous works for twenty-five years. There are special provisions
for terms of fifty years in the case of translations, adaptations,
compilations, etc., and for twenty-five years for editions of works of
undefined authorship. Registration is required with notice of reservation
of playright within six months from publication or three months from
performance of an unpublished play. Three copies of a printed work must be
deposited with the registrar for the use of the Minister of Public
Education, the National Library and the provincial library. Titles of
periodicals are specified as copyrightable. Assignment must be registered
to become operative. Protection is seemingly confined to a citizen of
Ecuador, but it is expressly provided that a foreign author may assign
right of translation or playright to a citizen of Ecuador, who may then
prevent infringement. Ecuador has reciprocal relations with Mexico (1888),
as also with France (1898, 1905) and Spain (1900), all on the "most
favored nation" basis.</p>

<p class="sidenote"> <a name="429a"></a>Colombia</p>

<p><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
429]</span>Colombia, under the Constitution and law of 1886, and the civil
code of 1873 and penal code of 1890, protects copyright, including
playright, for life and eighty years, and for the legal existence of a
corporate body, with the provision as in Spain respecting natural heirs.
Registration is required within a year from publication or performance, at
the Ministry of Public Education, with deposit of three copies, one for
the Ministry and two for the National Library. If a work is not registered
within the year, it falls into the public domain for ten years, but can
thereafter be protected by registration within the succeeding year.
Non-Colombian authors seem not to enjoy protection of the right of
translation for a work printed in a country of foreign language. Colombia
has treaties with Spain (1885) on the "most favored nation" basis, Italy
(1892) and Switzerland (1908).</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="429b"></a>Venezuela</p>

<p>Venezuela, under the law of 1894 and penal code of 1897, protects
copyright including playright in perpetuity, the publisher being
considered the author in the case of anonymous and pseudonymous works
pending legal proof of the identity of the author. In posthumous works
protection is in perpetuity to the heirs or assigns. The right is secured
by request to the district governor or state president for the issue of a
patent with registry of title and verbal oath that the work has not been
previously published within Venezuela or elsewhere; the patent certificate
must be printed on the back of the title-page, and must be published at
least four times in the official gazette. Deposit must be made of six
copies at the Registry, two copies going to the Minister of Agriculture
for the National Library. Protection is not specifically confined to
Venezuelans, and seems to depend on first publication, but assignment to a
citizen of Venezuela may be desirable. Venezuela has no foreign
relations.</p>

<h4>BUSINESS RELATIONS OF COPYRIGHT: AUTHOR AND PUBLISHER</h4>

<p class="p2 sidenote"><a name="430a"></a>Copyrights in their business
relations</p>

<p>Business relations, founded on copyright, are chiefly those between
author and publisher. These relations involve questions, not so much of
copyright law in itself, as of the law of contract and other statutory and
common law provisions. There has been more or less desire on the part of
authors to include business relations within copyright statutes, and in
fact the recommendations of the American (Authors) Copyright League to the
initial copyright conference of 1905 covered several points of business
law, as for instance the right of an author to recover possession of his
work from the publisher in case the publisher failed to keep it in print,
or the right to prevent assignment of publication rights to a publisher
unsatisfactory to the author. It was, however, determined, both in the
conferences and by the Congressional Committees, to omit as far as
practicable from the copyright law all questions of business relationship,
and to leave these to specific contracts between author and publisher or
to the general provisions of law. The law, whether as to copyright or
other matters, should afford a basis of certainty for business, but it
cannot wisely interfere with freedom of contract between the parties to a
business transaction.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="430b"></a>The German publishing law of
1901<br />

Editions<br />

Alterations</p>

<p>American and English statutes accordingly make no special regulation of
the calling of publisher. Provision is, however, made in some continental
countries for the regulation of publishing and publishers, as in Germany,
where a law of June 19, 1901, passed coincidently <a name="Page_431"
id="Page_431"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 431]</span>with the general
copyright code, covers this field in remarkable detail. It provides that
the author, during the continuance of the publishing contract within the
copyright period, may not reproduce or distribute the work otherwise than
through the publisher, except in translation, dramatization (or if a play,
novelization) or elaboration of a musical work which is not merely a
transposition or arrangement. The author is privileged to include his work
in a collected edition twenty years after publication, or an article from
a collective work after one year; and the publisher may not republish in
such form under the contract. Unless otherwise specified, the publisher is
entitled to print only one edition, if undefined one thousand copies, in
addition to extra copies for replacing damaged copies and not more than
five per cent free copies; destroyed copies may be replaced on notice to
author. Opportunity for revision must be afforded to the author in new
editions. Alterations are permitted to the author before reproduction and
at his expense during the progress of the work, but he cannot be charged
for alterations necessitated by new circumstances. The publisher may not
make alterations or abbreviation of text or title, except those to which
the author cannot fairly refuse consent.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Issuance of work</p>

<p>The publisher must issue the work in suitable form in accordance with
the customs of the trade and the character of the book, and immediately
after receipt of the complete work or completed separate part. The
publisher must take measures to keep the book in stock. He is not bound to
produce a new edition, but if on request from the author he fails to do
so, the publishing right reverts to the author. The publisher may cancel
the contract, if the purpose of a work no longer exists, on payment of
remuneration to the <a name="Page_432" id="Page_432"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 432]</span>author. Proof for correction must be
furnished to the author.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Price and remuneration</p>

<p>The publisher may fix and reasonably reduce the price, but can raise it
only with consent of the author. If remuneration is not specified, an
equitable payment is required, and the remuneration is due on the delivery
or on the appearance of the work, or if determined by sale, then yearly,
with opportunity to the author to verify the account from the publisher's
books. The author is entitled to free copies to the extent of one per cent
of the edition, but not less than five nor more than fifteen, and to
additional copies at the lowest trade price. The author is entitled to
return of his manuscript after reproduction, if stipulated at the
beginning.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Assignment</p>

<p>The publisher may assign, in the absence of agreement, but not for
separate works; though for this last, consent cannot unreasonably be
withheld and may be presumed if the author does not reply within two
months to a demand; and the assignee becomes, jointly with the original
publisher, liable to the author for future performance of the contract.
When a contract is completed by the issue of specified editions or copies,
the publisher is bound to notify the author, and if the contract is for a
definite time, the publisher is not entitled to distribute remaining
copies after that time. In case of delay in the contracted delivery of
the work, the publisher, after a reasonable extension of time, may decline
the work, unless delay involves only insignificant loss; and in case the
work is not of stipulated quality, the publisher may also cancel the
contract or require damages for non-fulfillment. The author has analogous
rights as against the publisher.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Accidental destruction<br />

Delivery</p>

<p>If the work is accidentally destroyed after delivery to the publisher,
the author is entitled to remuneration, but the contract terminates; but
the author <a name="Page_433" id="Page_433"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
433]</span>must, if practicable, rewrite it for additional remuneration or
may reproduce it gratuitously and require publication. Like rights may be
enforced by either party in case of destruction for which the other is
responsible. Delivery is implied when the publisher is placed in position
to accept the work. If the author dies after delivery of part of his work,
the publisher may maintain his rights in the part delivered on specified
notice to heirs; and if the author is absolutely prevented from completing
his work, the publisher has like right to the portion already prepared.
The author may withdraw from his contract before reproduction of his work
or a new edition is begun, if justified by unforeseen circumstances, on
remuneration of publisher's expenses; but if he publishes elsewhere within
a year, he must also pay damages for non-fulfillment of contract to the
original publisher, unless the latter has declined to resume the
contract.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Bankruptcy of publisher<br />

Non-copyright work</p>

<p>The relations of a publisher in case of bankruptcy are specifically
treated, and the regulations of the civil code and general legal
principles are specifically applied to cancellation of publishing
contracts. On a non-copyright work, an author must not conceal from the
publisher that he cannot transfer exclusive right of publication; but the
author must act toward the publisher as though the work were copyrighted,
at least until six months after publication.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Articles in periodicals</p>

<p>The law is made applicable to articles in periodicals or portions of
collective works. An article in a newspaper is at the disposal of the
author immediately after publication; an article in other periodicals
after one year, unless exclusive continuing right has been sold to the
publisher. A publisher is free to make usual alterations in an unsigned
article. The author of an article may cancel his contract and obtain
remuneration in case it is not published within a year <a name="Page_434"
id="Page_434"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 434]</span>after delivery, but
damages can be claimed only in case a time of publication has been named
by the publisher. The author of a newspaper article has no claim to free
copies or special terms. In the case of a work planned by the publisher,
or a collaborative, supplementary or collective work commissioned by the
publisher, the publisher is not bound to reproduce and distribute the
work. The law is made applicable in case the contract with the publisher
is made by another than the author. Appeal is authorized to the Supreme
Court of the Empire.</p>

<p>It is impracticable to cite all the details of this extraordinarily
detailed law, but the provisions summarized afford a remarkable conspectus
of German practice on business questions possibly arising between author
and publisher, useful in relation to American and English practice.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="434a"></a>The publisher as merchant<br />

<a name="434b"></a>"Outright" transfer</p>

<p>The publisher is the merchant for the author, and the remuneration
which he can pay to the author is limited by the price and sale which he
can obtain from the book-buying public. The relation between author and
publisher should be, as previously emphasized, most fully, clearly and
specifically set forth in the initial contract. "Agreements between author
and publishers," said Vice Chancellor Page Wood in 1857 in Reade <i>v.</i>
Bentley, "assume a variety of forms. Some are so clear and explicit that
no doubt can arise upon them. Thus, where an author assigns his copyright,
the transaction is one which every person understands, and which leaves no
room for uncertainty as to the rights of the parties." The work may indeed
be transferred "outright" without written contract, by the delivery of the
manuscript and payment of a bargained sum, in which case the publisher
becomes the proprietor and may take out the copyright in his own name or
that of the author, can assign the <a name="Page_435"
id="Page_435"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 435]</span>work and treat it
entirely as though his own, except that he cannot alter it to the
detriment of the author's reputation. But even in "outright" sale, a
specific contract is desirable and is indeed necessary if the author is to
agree with the publisher to apply for renewal and include the added period
in the term.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="435a"></a>"Joint adventure"</p>

<p>More usually, the contract between author and publisher is on the basis
of a specified royalty&mdash;usual in America, or "half
profits,"&mdash;more common in England, in which case the relation is not
that of partnership but of a "joint adventure" terminable on notice unless
it is made for a stated time, or for one or more editions, of a specified
number of copies, or under other limiting conditions. In such case the
expenses of publication may be borne by the publisher, or the author may
pay for the plates or for the edition, and receive correspondingly larger
return. Unless there is actual or constructive partnership, the publisher,
and not the author, is liable for paper, printing, and like accounts. Or
the publisher may be simply the agent of the author in manufacturing his
book and selling for a stated commission. A contract of publication
usually implies exclusive right, but an author may contract with several
publishers under a license agreement; and on the compulsory license
system, often miscalled the "royalty plan," he must permit any publisher,
who will pay him the license royalty, to issue the work.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="435b"></a>Risk and profit</p>

<p>It is by means of the profit on successful books that the publisher is
able to take risks with new books and new authors. It has been said that
of five books, three fail, one covers its cost, the fifth must pay a
profit to cover the rest. The element of risk in the book business is, in
fact, very large; if the author complains that his successful book ought
not to pay for others' unsuccessful books, he can get over the difficulty
by taking the risk himself. </p>

<p class="sidenote"> <a name="436a"></a>Long price and "net" price<br />

<a name="436b"></a>Equities</p>

<p><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
436]</span>The publisher usually sells to the public through the retail
trade at a stated retail price, which may be either long price, in which
case the high price and large trade discount permit a discount to the
public, or "net" price, a lower price with less discount, which the
bookseller is expected to maintain. The practice of issuing books at "net"
price is growing, in the belief that through this policy larger sales are
made and the publisher's gains and the author's royalties fairly balance.
On the average, the publisher probably gets less per volume than the
author, and the system is essentially on an equitable basis. The
publisher's larger returns come from the fact that he handles more books
than any one author writes. The publisher has usually, in bargaining with
the author, the advantage of larger experience and superior business
ability, and of the fact that the author seeks him rather than he the
author; but no law can better the author in these respects. As a matter of
practice, the better publishing houses treat with new authors on the same
basis as with old, through a standard form of contract.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="436c"></a>The literary agent</p>

<p>The author sometimes employs the "literary agent" as an intermediary in
finding a publisher, especially for a first book, and in making
arrangements with the publisher, for which the agent expects a stated
payment or a proportion of the author's returns. The advantages of such
intermediaries are offset by many disadvantages, and the best publishing
houses treat an author as liberally and fairly in direct as through
intermediate relations. In any event, the contract should be made and
signed directly between author and publisher, as a third-party contract,
or a double contract between author and agent and agent and publisher,
presents serious complication in the event of future differences. The
agent should not be given any lien on future works by the author. The
literary <a name="Page_437" id="Page_437"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
437]</span>agent cannot accept conditions or make sale beyond the
authority given him by the author, and an innocent publisher may be held
responsible for acts beyond that authority, as in the English case of
Heinemann <i>v.</i> Smart Set Pub. Co., in 1909, where the defendants had
bought "serial rights" with leave to condense into one number, which the
agent had no authority to grant.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="437a"></a>Usual American contract</p>

<p>In the publishing contract usual in America, the author "grants and
assigns" to the publishers the stated work, undertaking either to
copyright it himself or authorizing the publishers to enter copyright in
their name, or as his attorneys in his name. The contract usually includes
all translations, abridgments, selections, dramatizations, etc., or
specifically reserves those to the author, the publishers in the first
case agreeing to share profits or otherwise remunerate the author on such
special forms. The author is expected to guarantee that he is sole owner
of the work and has full power to make the grant, that the work is not a
violation of any other copyright and that it is free from scandalous or
libelous matter.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="437b"></a>Publishers' obligations</p>

<p>The publishers undertake to publish the work in such style as they deem
best suited to its sale, at their own expense, unless the author contracts
to pay for the plates or for other publishing costs, and usually agree to
account for sales semi-yearly or yearly and to make payments within four
months thereafter. The royalty is usually based on the trade-list (retail)
price, on the cloth or ordinary binding, or the style of binding in which
the largest number of copies shall have been sold. It is frequently
stipulated that on paper-bound copies, or editions or copies for schools
or subscription sale, or a foreign market, or otherwise sold at a reduced
price, the royalty shall be reduced, and that on press and other free
copies no royalty shall <a name="Page_438" id="Page_438"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 438]</span>be paid. When an author pays the cost of
the edition or pays for making the plates, he may contract to pay a
commission to the publisher and obtain the balance for himself, or he may
contract for a larger percentage of return to him than the usual royalty
percentage. The publishers are usually authorized to permit the printing
of selections and to arrange for translations, etc., subject to the
arrangement indicated above. The author is expected to pay for alterations
either in full or above a stated sum, as fifty dollars, and to provide any
index or like equipment if required.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="438a"></a>Reversion of contract</p>

<p>Insurance is not usually required from the publishers, but in case of
fire or loss, the publishers have the option of reproducing the work, and
if they decline to do so, the contract usually provides for reconveyance
of the copyright to the author and the termination of the agreement after
the sale of copies remaining on hand. A publishing contract sometimes
provides that after a specified time from date of publication, as two or
five years, if the publishers consider that the public demand does not
justify continuing publication, or for other reasons, they may offer to
surrender their publishing rights on compensation for the plates, as at
half cost, and remaining copies, as at cost, and if the author does not
elect to accept this offer, then the publishers may sell copies on hand
free from royalty and terminate the agreement, the copyright reverting to
the author. The publishers are usually authorized, in their discretion, to
protect the copyright by legal proceedings at their expense or at joint
expense of publishers and author.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="438b"></a>Scope of contract</p>

<p>The contract may be for the full term of copyright, with or without
obligation on the part of the author to provide for renewal, or for a
stated number of years and thereafter until terminated on stated notice,
or it may be for a specified number of editions <a name="Page_439"
id="Page_439"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 439]</span>or copies. It is
often stipulated that on discontinuance, the author shall have the right
to take over the plates at cost or half cost and remaining copies at cost,
in default of which the publishers may sell copies free of
royalty,&mdash;but not continue to use the plates. If the book contains
illustrations not made originally for the work, the contract may provide
that electrotypes of them shall be transferred to the author for use
solely in connection with the work in case of reversion of the copyright
to him. The contract is usually drawn subject to assignment by either
party, but only as a whole; but the author may require that the work shall
not be transferred, to another publisher or otherwise, without his
consent.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="439a"></a>Other works of author</p>

<p>The contract may also reserve to the author a right to discontinue the
agreement in case the publishers elect not to publish other works, which
he may offer to them, or it may bind the author to offer subsequent works
to the same publishers. This keeps in view the ultimate publication of a
uniform collected edition of the author's works, which may also be covered
by a provision giving the author right to include his work in a collected
edition after a stated time.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="439b"></a>Standard contract</p>

<p>The above summary gives the pith of a standard form of contract which
has been adopted, in more or less detail, by many American publishers, and
is usually kept in printed form by them. Owing to the careful
specifications in the American type of contract, there are fewer cases in
the American than in the English court records referring to the relation
between authors and publishers; and the English "half profits" custom
naturally leaves many more open questions of law and equity.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="439c"></a>Serial rights</p>

<p>Where there are serial rights to be considered, as in the case of a
novel, the agreement between author and publisher should be very clear. If
an author contracts <a name="Page_440" id="Page_440"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 440]</span>for a serial with periodical publishers who
are also book publishers, that contract should state whether rights for
book publication are involved or whether the author is left free to
arrange for book publication independently. Conversely, where an author
contracts for book publication, the contract should be explicit as to
whether the author or the publishers shall exercise or arrange for serial
publication, either before or after book publication.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="440a"></a>Republication of periodical
articles</p>

<p>Where an author furnishes an article or series of articles for a
periodical, it should be made clear, by letter or contract, whether the
periodical publisher also obtains the right to republish such articles in
other shape or whether such right reverts to the author, and if so, how
soon after publication of the periodical.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="440b"></a>Foreign markets</p>

<p>In these days of increasing international relations, it is important
that the author should have a clear understanding as to whether he retains
the rights in other markets, whether in English speaking or foreign
countries; or conveys them to the publishers as within the agreement, but
to be separately accounted for; or assigns them as an integral part of the
transaction. As between America and England, many publishing firms have
branch houses or representatives in the other country or are in special
relations with an independent firm therein. If the English market is
conveyed, there should be a clear-cut understanding as to whether this
includes the Canadian, Australian and South African rights. It is usual
that a lower royalty is paid to the author on sheets sold for another than
the home market.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="440c"></a>Contract to do work</p>

<p>The contract of an author with a publisher that he <i>will</i> write a
specified book or work, is not usually enforceable by the courts through
specific performance, for the simple reason that a court has no means of
compelling <a name="Page_441" id="Page_441"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
441]</span>an author to use his brain for a certain purpose, and the
remedy against the author in this event is rather a suit for loss by
failure to perform the contract, which loss is difficult to prove. If any
remedy is to be provided, it should be stated in the contract as a
specified penalty to be paid by the author,&mdash;a provision seldom
included in publishing contracts. That an author may be held liable for a
breach of contract if he declined without good cause to complete a work
already partly delivered, was indicated in the early English case of Gale
<i>v.</i> Leckie in 1817. An agreement to write a book may stand as an
equitable assignment on the completion of the book, as was held in Ward,
Lock &amp; Co. <i>v.</i> Long, in 1906 in the Chancery Division by Justice
Kekewich.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="441"></a>Contract not to write</p>

<p>An author who has contracted not to write on a stated subject or for
other publishers, may be enjoined from such act. This was decided by early
English precedents, as when in the case of Morris <i>v.</i> Colman, in
1812, Lord Chancellor Eldon held that Colman, in virtue of his contract to
write plays for the Haymarket Theatre and for no other, could be
restrained from furnishing plays to another theatre, though he could not
be compelled to write plays; the same judge, in Clarke <i>v.</i> Price,
held in 1819 that he could neither compel Price to continue to furnish
Exchequer reports to the plaintiff publisher nor restrain him from
furnishing such reports to another publisher, because the contract
contained no specific provision to the latter effect. It is probable that
the undertaking of an author not to prejudice the sale of his book by
writing another of like subject, though under a different title, may be
enforced even against a succeeding publisher who had no knowledge of that
undertaking, as was indicated in Barfield <i>v.</i> Nicholson in 1824.
Thus publishers were granted equitable relief <a name="Page_442"
id="Page_442"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 442]</span>against an author
who had sold to other publishers modifications of an arithmetical series
of which the copyright had been sold to the plaintiffs, in Wooster
<i>v.</i> Crane in the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in 1906. In
Brooke <i>v.</i> Chitty, however, in 1831, Lord Brougham declined to
restrain Chitty from writing a certain book, on the ground that the court
could not act until there was actual printing and publication. The
publisher, <i>vice versa</i>, cannot be restrained from publishing a rival
work, even though it competes directly with a work already published or
contracted for, unless that is distinctly forbidden in the contract with
the first author.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="442a"></a>Implied obligations</p>

<p>If a publisher prints without special agreement a manuscript submitted
for approval, the courts will enforce reasonable payment; and in 1893, in
Macdonald <i>v.</i> National Review, in an English county court, it was
held that printer's proof sent by the publisher to the author, implied
acceptance for publication. That the publisher may be held responsible for
loss of a manuscript by the negligence of his employees, was held in Stone
<i>v.</i> Long, in the King's Bench Division, by Master Chitty in 1903. An
implied obligation to publish an accepted work was recognized in the
Canadian case of Le Sueur v. Morang, where the Canadian Supreme Court
affirmed in 1911 the decision that if a publisher withholds from
publication a work of which he had bought the copyright "outright," the
author might claim the work on return of the purchase money.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="442b"></a>Contract personal and mutual</p>

<p>The contract between author and publisher is of a personal nature and
therefore not assignable, in the absence of specific provision, except
with consent of the other party. As it is with a particular author that a
publisher contracts for a book, so an author contracts with a publisher of
his choice and cannot be <a name="Page_443" id="Page_443"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 443]</span> required to accept another. This is
especially true where, on a profit-sharing or royalty arrangement, the
author relies on the skill of the publisher for his market. Where E. V.
Lucas had arranged with Grant Richards to publish a work on half profit,
it was held in the Chancery Division in 1905 by Justice Warrington in a
suit against the publishers' trustee in bankruptcy, that the contract was
terminated by bankruptcy and that Mr. Lucas on fair purchase of the
remaining copies, might contract with another publisher. There is more
question when the contract is for a specified sum; and where the copyright
is assigned by outright purchase the rule would not hold good, for the
publisher then becomes the copyright proprietor. But even when a publisher
has bought a copyright "outright," he may not do the author the wrong of
printing the work in such altered shape as to injure the author's
reputation, as was held in 1832 in the English case of Archbold <i>v.</i>
Sweet, where a third edition of Archbold's legal work printed "with very
considerable additions," which the plaintiff showed to contain gross
blunders, was enjoined. But when work is done, to be published under the
name of another, the actual writer may not prevent alteration by the
employer, as was decided in Cox <i>v.</i> Cox in 1853, by the Vice
Chancellor. Such a personal contract cannot be transferred as a bankruptcy
asset, and on the bankruptcy of the publisher the rights revert to the
author, except that stock on hand may perhaps be sold to another, who may
not, however, distribute it to the disadvantage of the author. The
personal contract involves personal guarantee by each party to the other
of good faith and coöperative support, and neither party may act to the
disadvantage of the other. The author, during the continuance of a
publishing contract, must not permit the use of his <a name="Page_444"
id="Page_444"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 444]</span>work otherwise, to
the prejudice of the original publisher, and the publisher must not sell
copies to the injury of the future market of the author.</p>

<p class="sidenote">English development of this doctrine</p>

<p>This general doctrine was worked out in a chain of early English cases,
the first of which was that of Sweet <i>v.</i> Cater, in 1841, where Vice
Chancellor Shadwell decided that the plaintiff publisher who had
contracted with Sir Edward Sugden to publish a tenth edition of 2500
copies of his legal work, could, until the specified copies were sold,
prevent the publishing of another edition by the defendant publisher,
despite any arrangements between the author and the latter. It was
strongly upheld by Vice Chancellor Page Wood in the case of Stevens
<i>v.</i> Benning, in 1854, affirmed on appeal by the Lords Justices, and
Reade <i>v.</i> Bentley, in 1857. In the first case Forsyth contracted for
the publication of his legal work, undertaking to make future revision for
subsequent editions, with the publishing firm of the elder Benning, and on
its bankruptcy, four hundred copies of the second edition were sold to
Stevens &amp; Norton, which firm sued to prevent the younger Benning from
publishing a third edition as revised by Forsyth. The Vice Chancellor held
that though the plaintiffs might presumably sell the copies, if done
without disadvantage to the author, the original contract was not an
assignment, but a personal contract which could not pass to the
plaintiffs, and therefore denied an injunction. In the second case, where
Charles Reade sought to resume his rights in "Peg Woffington" and
"Christie Johnstone," from his publisher Bentley, after all expenses had
been paid and profits on several editions accounted for, the Vice
Chancellor held that the contract, as of a personal nature, could be
terminated by the author when that did not involve loss to the other
party. Copies printed to replace others destroyed by <a name="Page_445"
id="Page_445"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 445]</span>fire were decided
in the case of Blackwood <i>v.</i> Brewster, in 1860, in the Scotch Court
of Session, not to constitute a new edition. In the later case of Hole
<i>v.</i> Bradbury, in 1879, a joint author and the heir of a deceased
joint author of "A little tour in Ireland" were adjudged by Justice Fry to
be entitled to resume their rights and to recover the illustrations from
publishers who had succeeded to the business of the original publishing
firm.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="445a"></a>Author's transfer to other
publishers</p>

<p>In Warne <i>v.</i> Routledge, in 1874, where Mrs. Cook sought to
transfer from one publisher to another without notice a book of which
44,000 copies had been printed and 42,000 sold, the plaintiff publisher
sought to restrain the defendant from issuing a new edition until the
remaining copies had been sold. Sir George Jessel, M. R., held that the
right of publishing was an exclusive one for the time of the contract,
though the word exclusive was not used, but that the author could provide
for publication by another publisher immediately on terminating a
contract,&mdash;a decision which has been criticized as not compatible
with other decisions nor sound law.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="445b"></a>Proprietary name</p>

<p>Where a proprietary name becomes identified with a publication, an
assignment of the work may estop the person named from use of his name or
advertisement of his service elsewhere, as in the English case of Ward
<i>v.</i> Beeton, in 1875, where the originator of "Beeton's Christmas
Annual," who had been dismissed by the publishers of that work, was
restrained from advertising that he would edit a similar publication for
another publisher. But the editor's name is not necessarily part of the
title, and an editor may not restrain its omission from the title-page, as
was held in the English case of Crookes <i>v.</i> Petter, in 1860.</p>

<p class="sidenote"> <a name="446"></a>Copies remaining unsold</p>

<p><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
446]</span>It was decided in the English case of Howitt <i>v.</i> Hall, in
1862, by Vice Chancellor Page Wood, that where a publisher had procured
from an author the copyright for a limited term, in that case four years,
he had the right to sell, after the expiration of the contract term,
copies printed in good faith within the term, though the court indicated
that if there had been an excessive printing of the work with the evident
purpose of stocking up for sale after expiration of the contract, such
course would not be permitted. This precedent indicates that a publisher
would have the right to sell copies printed during the original term of
copyright and remaining in stock, even if an author under the renewal
provision of the American code exercised the right to make arrangements
with another publisher for the renewal term. To like effect it was decided
in the English case of Taylor <i>v.</i> Pillow, in 1869, by Vice
Chancellor James, that a copyright proprietor assigning the copyright
might thereafter dispose of copies of a song remaining unsold, in the
absence of stipulations to the contrary. These questions are usually
decided in advance in American publishing practice by provision in the
contract between author and publisher that copies remaining unsold at the
end of the contract term may be reclaimed by the author at a stated
price&mdash;and some such provision is always desirable.</p>

<p class="sidenote">American confirmation</p>

<p>The same doctrine was upheld in the American case of Pulte <i>v.</i>
Derby, in 1852, in the U.&nbsp;S. Circuit Court by Judge McLean, who held
that where the contract for publishing a second edition provided that the
publishers might print as many copies as they could sell, the publishers
might make successive printings in that edition, and that the use of the
words "third edition" on the title-page did not terminate the arrangement.
The author could not meantime publish otherwise, but the publishers, who
held legal title to the copyright within the terms of the contract, could
<a name="Page_447" id="Page_447"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
447]</span>not exercise rights beyond the second edition, nor could they
assign their rights.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="447a"></a>Renewal term</p>

<p>American publishers usually expect the author to make a contract for
the entire copyright period, and to make application in their behalf for
the renewal term. It is true that the very large percentage of books lose
their value long before the close of the original term, and that the
percentage where renewal is desirable is very small.</p>

<p>It was a thought to which "Mark Twain's" mind often recurred that a
long copyright term was not desirable, because so few books were of value
at the end of one or two decades, and he frequently put forward a scheme
for extending copyright from period to period, based on the issuance of a
cheap edition under the author's sanction. This scheme, which he presented
in some detail at the time of the Congressional copyright hearings, did
not receive support from other students and advocates of copyright.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="447b"></a>License not assignment</p>

<p>A contract giving publishers the "whole and exclusive right of
publication," was decided <i>In re</i> Clinical Obstetrics by the Chancery
Court, through Justice Warrington, in 1908, to be a personal contract and
license, not an assignment of copyright, and the assignment entries were
ordered to be expunged, in line with the decision in 1907 by the Court of
Appeal in <i>Re</i> "The Liedertafel series" <i>et al.</i></p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="447c"></a>Author's and publisher's
profits</p>

<p>The publication of a book involves many indirect expenses, in addition
to the direct cost of manufacture, such as the share of general office
expenses, the large item of advertising and the like. These are difficult
to allot, and this helps to make the "half profits" system a fruitful
occasion of disagreements. On this system or on the commission basis, the
nature and proportion of these indirect charges should be clearly set
forth in the publishing agreement. On a "half <a name="Page_448"
id="Page_448"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 448]</span>profit" or similar
plan, the publisher is not considered to be entitled to make his own
profit on paper, printing, etc., but must account for these at the cost to
him; and in any event the publishers' accounts must be fully open to the
author. On the whole, the payment of royalty, on the usual American plan,
is more satisfactory. The customary royalty is ten per cent, or in the
case of authors of established reputation whose works have large sale, as
high as fifteen or twenty per cent, when the publishers cover all
expenses, except that on school books and "subscription" editions the
royalty is usually five per cent. When an author pays for the plates or
for the edition, the return is substantially higher, as fifteen or twenty
per cent to the ordinary author. The royalty is usually reckoned on
ordinary cloth binding, unless otherwise stated in the contract, and
almost invariably not on copies printed, but on copies sold. A royalty on
"all copies sold" was construed in the King's Bench Division by Justice
Walton, in Neufeld <i>v.</i> Chapman in 1901, to cover all forms of
publication, including royalty on a proportionate part of the sales price
of a periodical.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="448"></a>The publisher's share</p>

<p>The publisher does not, as is sometimes assumed, get the other ninety
per cent as profit; he gets the difference between the receipts from the
trade or public on copies <i>actually sold</i>&mdash;averaging perhaps two
thirds of the "retail price," on which the author's ten per cent (really
thus fifteen per cent) is reckoned&mdash;and the cost of making the
<i>entire edition</i> and of advertising and marketing the book. The
author, in any event, gets a return proportioned to the success of his
book. If its sales are small, the publisher makes a loss; if large, the
publisher makes a profit increasing proportionately after the initial
outlay for publication has been covered. </p>

<p class="sidenote"> <a name="449a"></a>"Author's editions"<br />

<a name="449b"></a>Printer's lien</p>

<p><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
449]</span>When an author arranges with a publisher or printer to issue a
book at author's expense, such editions being usually known as "author's
editions," great care should be taken to make such arrangements only with
publishers or printers of known and high character and to base them on a
complete and exact written contract, defining particularly the amount of
commission or royalty to be paid by or to the author, or the expenses to
be allowed before reckoning "half profits." Publishers of good repute make
such arrangements in the case of books not likely to show adequate
commercial profit, but there are publishers and printers who make a
business of such transactions with authors without adequately providing to
give the author the best possible market, and these cannot always be
expected to deal fairly with him. Arrangements made directly between an
author (or publisher) and a printer as such, are scarcely within the scope
of this work, but it may be said briefly that a printer usually has a
mechanic's lien on plates he has made or sheets he has printed (but not on
plates used by him unless he has made them), until the bills are paid; and
that he may not demand payment until the work has been completed, or in
case of its destruction by fire or otherwise, previous to complete
delivery, in the absence of contract obligation for advance or partial
payment.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="449c"></a>Compulsory license system</p>

<p>The compulsory license system, often miscalled "the royalty
plan,"&mdash;discussed in England in 1877 as the Farrer proposal and in
America about 1890 as the Pearsall-Smith scheme,&mdash;is provided by
legislation under which any publisher may publish a work without consent
of the author provided he pays a royalty as specified or stipulated in the
law, as ten or five per cent or a fixed sum per copy. This system has
unfortunately been adopted in the new American code, <a name="Page_450"
id="Page_450"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 450]</span>with reference to
the mechanical reproduction of music, though with the saving clause that
the author has complete right to forbid mechanical reproduction of his
musical composition so long as he does not license any manufacturer. This
American precedent has been followed as to mechanical music in recent
legislation by Germany and other continental countries and in the modified
British measure. The Italian copyright law has, however, a compulsory
license provision for the second forty years of copyright, under which any
publisher can issue a book on payment to the author of five per cent
royalty; and the new British measure contains a like provision applicable
twenty-five or thirty years after the author's death, on a basis of ten
per cent royalty.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="450"></a>License payments</p>

<p>The American provision is for two cents for each roll, under elaborate
regulations, as set forth in the chapter on mechanical music provisions.
It is doubtful whether those regulations can be effectively applied, and
indeed the whole provision may prove unconstitutional because of its
interference with the right of sale or license involved in private
property. The several substitutes for these regulations proposed and
discussed, were rejected as even less desirable&mdash;as the proposal that
the Copyright Office itself should undertake an elaborate system of
accounting and guarantee to the author as practically a ward of the state,
and another proposal for a system of stamps to be affixed to each copy
published, supplied by the Copyright Office or the author and sold to the
publisher, a system actually in practice in shoe manufacture under the
royalty system of the McKay Shoe Manufacturing Company. The answer to all
these schemes is that the author should be at liberty to make such
arrangements, by contract with one publisher or with many, as he may
please, and that a law to compel him <a name="Page_451"
id="Page_451"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 451]</span>to adopt any one
plan of marketing his wares would interfere with his freedom of choice and
his natural return.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="451a"></a>Saving through single publisher</p>

<p>The reason that an author chooses one publisher instead of many is the
simple one that the original cost of making and advertising a book is in
this way reduced to one outlay instead of multiplied in many, and that
this cost is minimized by being distributed over the largest possible
edition. It is the practice of any successful publisher to plan for such
an edition as will command the widest sale, and so distribute the original
cost over as many copies as possible, and when a copyright book proves to
be of such general demand that different styles of editions can be sold,
such editions are in fact made by the same publisher. The compulsory
license system would only protect the public against the unwisdom of
publishers, whose mistakes are presently corrected by business failure or
by the transfer of his books by the author to more enterprising
houses.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="451b"></a>Copyrights in bankruptcy</p>

<p>Copyrights are specifically included, with patents and trade-marks, in
the bankruptcy acts as assets which pass to the trustee, which applies to
a bankrupt author as well as to other copyright proprietors, but as
previously stated, this does not include the personal contract for the
publication of an unassigned work. This last doctrine was fully upheld in
the English case of Griffith <i>v.</i> Tower Pub. Co. &amp; Moncrieff, in
1897, by Justice Stirling, where the liquidator of a corporation was
enjoined from transferring a copyright direct to a publisher not
acceptable to the author. A manuscript as such is a tangible asset in
bankruptcy if of value in itself, but the right of the author to copyright
or to publish his manuscript is a personal and not a property right, which
therefore does not pass in case of bankruptcy, and a court would <a
name="Page_452" id="Page_452"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
452]</span>probably not undertake to compel an author to realize the value
of an unpublished work for the benefit of creditors by publication and
copyright. Nor may a bankrupt author be compelled in bankruptcy process to
complete his work, as was decided in 1841 in the English case of Gibson
<i>v.</i> Carruthers.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="452"></a>Copyrights in taxation</p>

<p>Copyrights, like patents, are subject to the inheritance tax, as
capitalized on the basis of income. In the appraisal of 1911 of the
copyrights of Mrs. Mary Baker G. Eddy, author of "Science and health," and
other Christian Science books, the valuation returned for tax purposes
reached $1,400,000, which is probably the largest valuation ever put upon
the copyrights of any one author. The copyrights of the late Marion
Crawford were appraised by the New York State tax authorities, in the same
year, by valuing his last novel at the income during its first year of
publication and his earlier novels at the income for three years passed.
Neither method afforded a fair valuation, as a work may be dead after its
first year, and the test by income through successive years would depend
on whether sales were decreasing or increasing during the period. Standard
school books are sometimes estimated as worth three years' income, but
such a generalization would not apply in other cases. Each valuation, for
tax or sales purposes, must depend upon the circumstances in each case. An
inheritance or other tax on copyrights, which are intangible property, may
fairly be questioned, in view of the uncertainty whether the legatees may
realize any future return from the property.</p>

<h4>THE LITERATURE OF COPYRIGHT</h4>

<p class="p2 sidenote"><a name="453a"></a>Bibliographical materials</p>

<p>The literature of copyright is extensive and its bibliography would now
make a volume in itself. The bibliography of literary property prepared by
Thorvald Solberg, now Register of Copyrights, for the Bowker-Solberg
volume of 1886, occupying sixty pages, covered approximately fifteen
hundred titles, besides analytical indexes to several periodicals. The
bibliography to the present date, inclusive of that material, which
Register Solberg has continued, would increase this record at least
twofold. The copyright campaign resulting in the code of 1909 was
especially prolific of drafts and bills, Congressional and other reports
and private publications, of which "dry as dust" indication is given in
the earlier chapter containing the record of that campaign. Nothing more
can be attempted in this chapter than a brief glance over historical
material and leading works.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="453b"></a>Early history</p>

<p>The early history of copyright is to be traced only through incidental
references in classical and medieval works. Among these may be instanced
Montalembert's "Monks of the West" and Brown's "History of the printing
press in Venice," previously cited. George Haven Putnam's work on "Books
and their makers in the Middle Ages" (New York, Putnams, 1896-97, 8vo, 2
v., 459, 538 p.), though dealing chiefly with publishing relations,
incidentally gives much information on the early history of printing
privileges and copyrights proper. Several of the law book writers, <a
name="Page_454" id="Page_454"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
454]</span>notably Copinger, summarize in some measure the early history
of copyright.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="454a"></a>Early American contributions</p>

<p>Perhaps the earliest American publication distinctively on copyright
was the "Remarks on literary property," by Philip H. Nicklin, in 1838, in
which he included as an appendix a reprint of Joseph Lowe's summary of
copyright history and practice up to 1819, from the Encyclopædia
Britannica supplement, and argued for longer, if not perpetual copyright
for our own authors, on the plea that "charity begins at home," as well as
for international copyright throughout a world-wide republic of letters.
The later movements in America for international copyright brought out
much writing, though largely in periodical articles and pamphlets, among
the most noteworthy of which were Dr. Francis Lieber's letter "On
international copyright," of 1840, Henry C. Carey's "Letters on
international copyright," of 1853, and "The international copyright
question considered," of 1872, George Haven Putnam's monograph on
"International copyright," of 1878, and Richard Grant White's "American
view of the copyright question," of 1880.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="454b"></a>Later American pamphleteers</p>

<p>During the copyright campaign leading to the act of 1891, several
pamphlets were issued on behalf of the American (Authors) Copyright
League, notably Rev. Dr. Henry van Dyke's "National sin of piracy," of
1888, and Prof. Brander Matthews's "Cheap books and good books," on the
texts of James Russell Lowell's epigram, "There is one thing better than a
cheap book, and that is a book honestly come by," and George William
Curtis's words, "Cheap books are good things, but cheapening the public
conscience is a very bad thing,"&mdash;which last paper is reprinted in
Putnam's "Question of copyright."</p>

<p>The leading American law book writer has been <a name="Page_455"
id="Page_455"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 455]</span>Eaton S. Drone,
later editor of the New York <i>Herald</i>, whose valuable "Treatise on
the law of property in intellectual productions in Great Britain and the
United States" (Boston, Little, Brown &amp; Co., 1879, 8vo, 774 p.)
covered comprehensively the general copyright legislation of 1870-74, and
superseded the earlier standard American law book, George Ticknor Curtis's
work of 1847, "Treatise on the law of copyright ... as enacted and
administered in England and America." The volume on "Copyright, its law
and its literature," by R. R. Bowker and Thorvald Solberg (N. Y.
<i>Publishers' Weekly</i>, 1886, 8vo, 136 p.), the latter furnishing the
bibliography of copyright, included facsimile of the autograph signatures
in the memorial of American authors of 1885, and a reprint of Sir James
Stephen's digest of British copyright law, as well as the revised
statutes, constituting the copyright law of the United States at that
time. "The question of copyright," by George Haven Putnam (N. Y., Putnams,
1891, 12mo, 412 p.), brought into one compilation many of the important
documents and articles, including the text of the act of 1891. A valuable
digest of "Copyright cases, 1891-1903," American and English, was compiled
by Arthur S. Hamlin for the American Publishers Copyright League (N. Y.,
Putnams, 1904, 8vo, 237 p.).</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="455b"></a>Copyright Office publications</p>

<p>The most valuable series of current publications on copyright are those
issued from the Library of Congress by the Copyright Office, under
Register Solberg's administration. The most important of these series is
that of Copyright Office <i>Bulletins</i> issued at irregular intervals,
of which No. 14 presents the current copyright law and No. 15, issued in
1910, gives the "Rules and regulations for the registration of claims to
copyright" under the new law. No. 3, as issued in a second edition in
1906, contains the full <a name="Page_456" id="Page_456"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 456]</span>text of "Copyright enactments of the United
States, 1783-1906," and No. 8, issued in 1905, "Copyright in Congress,
1789-1904," contains a bibliographical and chronological record of all
proceedings in Congress. Several bulletins were issued during the
preparation of the law of 1909, of which the most important was No. 9,
giving the "Provisions of the United States copyright laws with a summary
of some parallel provisions of the laws of foreign countries." No. 5
covers copyright in England, presenting the full text of copyright acts
from 1875 to 1902, including and supplementing Sir James Stephen's digest
of British copyright law; No. 6, "Copyright in Canada and Newfoundland" up
to 1903; No. 7, "Foreign copyright laws now in force" up to 1904; No. 11,
"Copyright in Japan" up to 1906; and No. 13, the documents of the
International Copyright Union, including the Berlin convention of 1908.
Bulletins No. 1 and 2 cover the former copyright law and directions for
registration under it. Many of these bulletins are already out of print. A
minor series is that of <i>Information circulars</i>, of which forty-five
have been published, many of them now out of date and superseded, covering
from time to time current information as to laws, proclamations, treaties,
etc., domestic and foreign, as well as opinions of the Attorneys-General,
custom regulations and the like.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="456a"></a>Labor report</p>

<p>A report on the effect of the international copyright law by the
Commissioner of Labor, Carroll D. Wright, was presented to the Senate in
1901.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="456b"></a>English contributions about
1840</p>

<p>Copyright literature in England is too extensive for more than brief
reference here. "The great debate," led by Serjeant Talfourd on one side
and Lord Macaulay on the other, is recorded in Hansard's Parliamentary
Debates (third series, volume LVI of 1841), and the speeches of the two
combatants are <a name="Page_457" id="Page_457"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 457]</span>reprinted in their respective works. John
James Lowndes's "Historical sketch of the law of copyright" was printed in
1840, with especial reference to Serjeant Talfourd's bill, and contained
an appendix on the state of copyright in foreign countries&mdash;America,
France, Holland and Belgium, the German states, Russia, Denmark, Norway
and Sweden, Spain, and the Two Sicilies. "A plea for perpetual copyright,"
by W. D. Christie, was also put forth in 1840. Carlyle's caustic "Petition
on the copyright bill" is included in his "Critical and miscellaneous
essays."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="457a"></a>Later English contributions</p>

<p>Among the later noteworthy contributions to the subject were the
caustic denunciation of international piracy by Charles Reade, the
novelist, under the title "The eighth commandment," reprinted in America
by Ticknor &amp; Fields, in 1860; Matthew Arnold's <i>Fortnightly</i>
article of 1880, on "Copyright," printed in the volume of his collected
works containing his "Irish essays"; John Camden Hotten's seven letters on
"Literary copyright," in a volume of 1871; and Walter Besant's volume "The
pen and the book," of 1899, containing a special chapter on copyright and
literary property by G. H. Thring, Secretary of the British Society of
Authors. Herbert Spencer made several contributions to the subject, some
of which were reprinted in his "Various fragments."</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="457b"></a>English legal treatises</p>

<p>There had been published, so early as 1823, the first edition of
Richard Godson's "Practical treatise on the law of patents for inventions
and of copyright," which was immediately translated into French and became
the standard English work, being supplemented in 1832 with an abstract of
the laws in foreign countries and republished in a second comprehensive
edition in 1840 by Saunders &amp; Benning, London; in 1844 this second
edition, with a supplement covering the recent laws, was reissued by W. <a
name="Page_458" id="Page_458"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
458]</span>Benning &amp; Co., in an octavo of 700 pages, and in 1851 a
separately published supplement by Peter Burke brought Godson's work up to
that date. Another early English law book was Robert Maugham's "Treatise
on the laws of literary property, comprising the statutes and cases; with
an historical view and disquisitions," published by Longmans in 1828. The
standard work of W. A. Copinger on "The law of copyright, in works of
literature and art," first published in 1870 and reissued in a fourth
edition, as edited by J. M. Easton (London, Stevens &amp; Haynes, 1904, 8vo,
1155 p.), includes as well as English and American decisions, chapters on
international copyright and on copyright in foreign countries, with full
text of English and many foreign statutes, and many legal forms. A work by
J. H. Slater covered "The law relating to copyright and trade-marks"
(London, Stevens, 1884, 8vo, 466 p.), in the form of a digest of the more
important English and American decisions. The writer of the York Prize
Essay of the University of Cambridge for 1882, T. E. Scrutton, rewrote and
extended his work under the title of "The law of copyright," later
continued into a fourth enlarged edition (London, Clowes, 1893, 4 ed.,
8vo, 356 p.). B. A. Cohen published a compact study of "The law of
copyright" in 1896.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="458a"></a>Birrell's lectures</p>

<p>Augustine Birrell, as Quain Professor of law at University College,
London, delivered a series of lectures in 1898, of which seven were
printed in his delightfully readable little volume on "The law and history
of copyright in books" (London, Cassell, 1899, 12mo, 228 p.).</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="458b"></a>MacGillivray's works</p>

<p>The latest English law book writer is E. L. MacGillivray, whose
"Treatise upon the law of copyright," British and American (London,
Murray, 1902, 8vo, 439 p.) is extremely valuable as a case <a
name="Page_459" id="Page_459"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
459]</span>digest, with foot-note references to cases. This was followed
by a brief "Digest of the law of copyright," English only, prepared by the
same writer for the Publishers Association of Great Britain and Ireland
(London, Butterworth, 1906, 12mo, 106 p.). The same association has
printed annually from 1901, a digest of "Copyright cases," which are
collected in two volumes, for 1901-04 and 1905-10 inclusive, also edited
by Mr. MacGillivray.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="459a"></a>English special treatises</p>

<p>Special English treatises on specific classes of copyright protection
are Colles and Hardy's "Playright and copyright in all countries" (London,
Macmillan, 1906, 8vo, 275 p.); Edward Cutler's "Manual of musical
copyright law" (London, Simpkin, Marshall, 1905, 8vo, 213 p.); Reginald
Winslow's "The law of artistic copyright" (London, Clowes, 1889, 8vo, 215
p.); Edmunds and Bentwich's "The law of copyright in designs" (London,
Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1908, 2 ed., 8vo, 488 p.); Knox and Hind's "Law of
copyright in designs" (London, Reeves &amp; Turner, 1899, 8vo, 264 p.);
and William Briggs's comprehensive treatise on "The law of international
copyright" (London, Stevens &amp; Haynes, 1906, 8vo, 870 p.), the most
important publication in English in its field.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="459b"></a>Parliamentary and Commission
reports</p>

<p>The Parliamentary papers giving reports of special commissions,
referred to in previous chapters, constitute an important part of the
English literature of copyright, the most notable being the report of the
Royal Copyright Commission issued in 1878, with Sir James Stephen's digest
of the law as then existing, and a supplementary blue-book of evidence;
the report of the Musical Copyright Committee appointed by the Home
Department, of 1904; the report of the Law of Copyright Committee
appointed by the President of the Board of Trade, of 1909, <a
name="Page_460" id="Page_460"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
460]</span>with accompanying minutes of evidence; and the minutes of the
Imperial Copyright Conference of 1909. The new copyright bill has been
four times printed in progressive form&mdash;on its first introduction,
July 26, 1910, on its reintroduction, March 30, 1911, as it emerged from
committee, July 13, 1911, and as it went to the Lords, August 18,
1911.</p>

<p>The pending Canadian bill has been printed only as introduced April 26,
1911, but the government has supplied an accompanying memorandum comparing
its provisions with existing law.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="460a"></a>Cyclopædias and digests</p>

<p>The American and English law cyclopædias and digests also give
references to copyright cases and decisions, some in special chapters,
more or less comprehensive of recent copyright interpretations.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="460b"></a>French works</p>

<p>The most recent authoritative French works on literary property are
Eugène Pouillet's "Traité théorique et pratique de la propriété littéraire
et artistique" (Paris, Marchal &amp; Billard, 3d ed., 1908, 1028 p.);
Gustave Huard's "Traité de la propriété intellectuelle, v. 1. Propriété
littéraire et artistique" (Paris, Marchal &amp; Billard, 1903, 400 p.),
and A. Huard and Édouard Mack's "Répertoire de législation, de doctrine et
de jurisprudence en matière de propriété littéraire et artistique" (Paris,
Marchal &amp; Billard, 1909, 740 p.). An earlier elaborate work is that of
Claude Couhin, "La propriété industrielle, artistique et littéraire"
(Paris, Larose, 1894), in three volumes.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="460c"></a>German works</p>

<p>For Germany the text of the general copyright law of June 19, 1901, of
the law relating to figurative arts and photographs of January 9, 1907,
and the amendatory law including mechanical music reproductions, May 22,
1910, should be consulted. Otto Lindemann's "Das Urheberrecht an Werken
der Literatur und der Tonkunst" (Berlin, Guttentag, 1910, <a
name="Page_461" id="Page_461"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 461]</span>3d
ed., 16mo, 155 p.) is a brief compilation of and comment on these laws of
1901 and 1910. The most recent and authoritative general works are Prof.
Josef Kohler's "Urheberrecht an Schriftwerken und Verlagsrecht"
(Stuttgart, F. Enke, 1907, 527 p.), though some of his statements of
theory have given rise to criticism and dispute, and his "Kunstwerkrecht"
(Stuttgart, Enke, 1908, 191 p.), Daude's "Die Reichsgesetze über das
Urheberrecht an Werken der Literatur und Tonkunst und das Verlagsrecht"
(Berlin, Guttentag, 1910, 293 p.), and Dr. Albert Osterrieth's "Das
Urheberrecht an Werken der bildenden Künste und der Photographie" (Berlin,
Heymann, 1907, 312 p.).</p>

<p class="sidenote">Early German contributions</p>

<p>In the early German literature of copyright should be noted the works
of Pütter, sometimes called the father of the modern theory of property in
intellectual productions, who wrote as early as 1764, an edition of whose
"Beyträge zum Teutschen Staats -u. Fürsten-Rechte" was published in
Göttingen in 1777; and the tractate of Immanuel Kant, "Von der
Unrechtmässigkeit des Büchernachdrucks," which may be found in his
collected works.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="461a"></a>Italian works</p>

<p>The most important Italian work of recent issue is that of Eduardo
Piola-Caselli, "Del diritto di autore" (Naples, E. Marghieri, 1907, 875
p.), and earlier works of standard character are Enrico Rosmini's
"Legislazione e jurisprudenza sui diritti d'autore" (Milan, M. Hoepli,
1890, 671 p.), and Pietro Esperson, "De' diritti di autore sulle opere
dell'ingegno ne' rapporti internazionali" (Torino, Unione
tipografico-editrice, 1899, 278 p.).</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="461b"></a>Spanish compendium</p>

<p>A useful compendium of Spanish copyright law of 1879 <i>et seq.</i>,
covering both the Peninsula and the <i>ultramar</i> colonies, was
published in Havana by La Propaganda Literaria, in 1890, as edited with an
interesting <a name="Page_462" id="Page_462"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
462]</span>comparison of Spanish law with that of Great Britain and
America by D. F. G. Garofalo y Morales.</p>

<p class="sidenote"><a name="462"></a>International compilations</p>

<p>A most valuable compilation of the copyright laws and treaties of all
countries, comprising a literal translation into German of about 250 acts,
is "Gesetze über das Urheberrecht in allen Ländern," edited in a second
edition by Prof. Ernest Röthlisberger (Leipzig, Hedeler, 1902, 418 p.),
which was complemented by his summary of the domestic and international
law of copyright in the different countries, "Der interne und der
internationale Schutz des Urheberrechts," also in its second edition
(Leipzig, Boersenverein der deutschen Buchhändler, 1904, 116 p.),
comprising references or mentions covering fifty-seven countries and
forty-nine colonies, especially the British colonies. With these should be
mentioned "Recueil des conventions et traités concernant la propriété
littéraire et artistique," published under the auspices of the Bureau of
the International Copyright Union (Berne, Bureau de l'Union
internationale, 1904, 8vo, 908 p.). These works are supplemented by the
publication from month to month in the <i>Droit d'Auteur</i> of Berne, of
which Prof. Röthlisberger is the editor, of new conventions, treaties,
laws and other material, bringing world-information up to date.</p>

entitled "An act to amend and consolidate the acts respecting copyright,"
that the benefits of said act, excepting the benefits under section 1
(<i>e</i>) thereof, as to which special conditions are imposed, shall
extend to the work of an author or proprietor who is a citizen or subject
of a foreign state or nation, only upon certain conditions set forth in
section 8 of said act, to wit:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) When an alien author or proprietor shall be domiciled within
the United States at the time of the first publication of his work: or</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) When the foreign state or nation of which such author or
proprietor is a citizen or subject grants, either by treaty, convention,
agreement, or law, to citizens of the United States the benefit of
copyright on substantially the same basis as to its own citizens, or
copyright protection substantially equal to the protection secured to such
foreign author under this act or by treaty; or when such foreign state or
nation is a party to an international agreement which provides for
reciprocity in the granting of copyright, by the terms of which agreement
the United States may, at its pleasure, become a party thereto:</p>

<p>And whereas it is also provided by said section that "The existence of
the reciprocal conditions aforesaid shall be determined by the President
of the United States, by proclamation made from time to time as the
purposes of this act may require":</p>

those countries:</p>

of America, do declare and proclaim that one of the alternative conditions
specified in section 8, of the act of March 4, 1909, is now fulfilled, and
since July 1, 1909, has continuously been fulfilled, in respect to the
citizens or subjects of Austria, Belgium, Chile, Costa Rica, Cuba,
Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain and her possessions, Italy,
Mexico, the Netherlands and possessions, Norway, Portugal, Spain, and
Switzerland, and that the citizens or subjects of the aforementioned
countries are and since July 1, 1909, have been entitled to all the
benefits of the said act other than the benefits under section 1

matrices, etc., or other means for making the copies alleged to infringe
the copyright, and the value of the same, and with such affidavit shall
file with the clerk a bond executed by at least two sureties and approved
by the court or a commissioner thereof.</p>

<p><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
492]</span> 4. Such bond shall bind the sureties in a specified sum, to be
fixed by the court, but not less than twice the reasonable value of such
infringing copies, plates, records, molds, matrices, or other means for
making such infringing copies, and be conditioned for the prompt
prosecution of the action, suit or proceeding; for the return of said
articles to the defendant, if they or any of them are adjudged not to be
infringements, or if the action abates, or is discontinued before they are
returned to the defendant; and for the payment to the defendant of any
damages which the court may award to him against the plaintiff or
complainant. Upon the filing of said affidavit and bond, and the approval
of said bond, the clerk shall issue a writ directed to the marshal of the
district where the said infringing copies, plates, records, molds,
matrices, etc., or other means of making such infringing copies shall be
stated in said affidavit to be located, and generally to any marshal of
the United States, directing the said marshal to forthwith seize and hold
the same subject to the order of the court issuing said writ, or of the
court of the district in which the seizure shall be made.</p>

<p>5. The marshal shall thereupon seize said articles or any smaller or
larger part thereof he may then or thereafter find, using such force as
may be reasonably necessary in the premises, and serve on the defendant a
copy of the affidavit, writ, and bond by delivering the same to him
personally, if he can be found within the district, of if he can not be
found, to his agent, if any, or to the person from whose possession the
articles are taken, or if the owner, agent, or such person can not be
found within the district by leaving said copy at the usual place of abode
of such owner or agent with a person of suitable age and discretion, or at
the place where said articles are found, and shall make immediate return
of such seizure, or attempted seizure, to the court. He shall also attach
to said articles a tag or label stating the fact of such seizure and
warning all persons from in any manner interfering therewith.</p>

<p><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
493]</span> 6. A marshal who has seized alleged infringing articles, shall
retain them in his possession, keeping them in a secure place, subject to
the order of the court.</p>

<p>7. Within three days after the articles are seized, and a copy of the
affidavit, writ and bond are served as hereinbefore provided, the
defendant shall serve upon the clerk a notice that he excepts to the
amount of the penalty of the bond, or to the sureties of the plaintiff or
complainant, or both, otherwise he shall be deemed to have waived all
objection to the amount of the penalty of the bond and the sufficiency of
the sureties thereon. If the court sustain the exceptions it may order a
new bond to be executed by the plaintiff or complainant, or in default
thereof within a time to be named by the court, the property to be
returned to the defendant.</p>

<p>8. Within ten days after service of such notice, the attorney of the
plaintiff or complainant shall serve upon the defendant or his attorney a
notice of the justification of the sureties, and said sureties shall
justify before the court or a judge thereof at the time therein
stated.</p>

<p>9. The defendant, if he does not except to the amount of the penalty of
the bond or the sufficiency of the sureties of the plaintiff or
complainant, may make application to the court for the return to him of
the articles seized, upon filing an affidavit stating all material facts
and circumstances tending to show that the articles seized are not
infringing copies, records, plates, molds, matrices, or means for making
the copies alleged to infringe the copyright.</p>

<p>10. Thereupon the court in its discretion, and after such hearing as it
may direct, may order such return upon the filing by the defendant of a
bond executed by at least two sureties, binding them in a specified sum to
be fixed in the discretion of the court, and conditioned for the delivery
of said specified articles to abide the order of the court. The <a
name="Page_494" id="Page_494"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
494]</span>plaintiff or complainant may require such sureties to justify
within ten days of the filing of such bond.</p>

<p>11. Upon the granting of such application and the justification of the
sureties on the bond, the marshal shall immediately deliver the articles
seized to the defendant.</p>

<p>12. Any service required to be performed by any marshal may be
performed by any deputy of such marshal.</p>

<p>13. For services in cases arising under this section, the marshal shall
be entitled to the same fees as are allowed for similar services in other
cases.</p>

<h3>4. UNITED STATES COPYRIGHT OFFICE<br /> REGULATIONS</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rules and Regulations for the
Registration of Claims to Copyright</span></p>

<p class="sidenote">Copyright under act</p>

<p>1. Copyright under the act of Congress entitled: "An act to amend and
consolidate the acts respecting copyright," approved March 4, 1909, is
ordinarily secured by printing and publishing a copyrightable work with a
notice of claim in the form prescribed by the statute. Registration can
only be made <i>after</i> such publication, but the statute expressly
provides, in certain cases, for registration of manuscript works.</p>

<p class="center p2">WHO MAY SECURE COPYRIGHT</p>

<p class="sidenote">Persons entitled to copyright</p>

<p>2. The persons entitled by the act to copyright protection for their
works are:</p>

<p>(1) The <i>author</i> of the work, if he is:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) A citizen of the United States, or</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) A resident alien domiciled in the United States at the time
of the first publication of his work, or</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) A citizen or subject of any country which grants either by
treaty, convention, agreement, or law, to citizens of the United States
the benefit of copyright on substantially the same basis as to its own
citizens. The existence of reciprocal copyright conditions is determined
by presidential proclamation.</p>

<p>(2) The <i>proprietor</i> of a work. The word "proprietor" is here used
to indicate a person who derives his title to the work from the author.
If the author of the work should be a person who could not himself claim
the benefit of the copyright act, the proprietor can not claim it.</p>

<p>(3) The <i>executors</i>, <i>administrators</i> or <i>assigns</i> of
the above-mentioned author or proprietor.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Copyright registration</p>

<p>3. After the publication of any work entitled to copyright, the
claimant of copyright should register this claim in the Copyright Office.
An action for infringement of <a name="Page_496" id="Page_496"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 496]</span>copyright can not be maintained in court
until the provisions with respect to the deposit of copies and
registration of such work shall have been complied with.</p>

<p>A certificate of registration is issued to the applicant and duplicates
thereof may be obtained on payment of the statutory fee of 50 cents.</p>

<p class="p2 center">SUBJECT-MATTER OF COPYRIGHT</p>

<p class="sidenote">Works subject to copyright</p>

<p>4. The act provides that no copyright shall subsist in the original
text of any work published prior to July 1, 1909, which has not been
already copyrighted in the United States (sec. 7).</p>

<p>Section 5 of the act divides the works for which copyright may be
secured into eleven classes, as follows:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Books.</i>&mdash;This term includes all printed literary
works (except dramatic compositions) whether published in the ordinary
shape of a book or pamphlet, or printed as a leaflet, card, or single
page. The term "book" as used in the law includes tabulated forms of
information, frequently called charts; tables of figures showing the
results of mathematical computations, such as logarithmic tables,
interest, cost, and wage tables, etc.; single poems, and the words of a
song when printed and published without music; librettos; descriptions of
moving pictures or spectacles; encyclopædias; catalogues; directories;
gazetteers and similar compilations; circulars or folders containing
information in the form of reading matter other than mere lists of
articles, names and addresses, and literary contributions to periodicals
or newspapers.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Blank books, etc., not copyrightable</p>

<p>5. The term "book" can not be applied to&mdash;</p>

<p>Blank books for use in business or in carrying out any system of
transacting affairs, such as record books, account books, memorandum
books, diaries or journals, bank deposit and check books; forms of
contracts or leases which do not contain original copyrightable matter;
coupons; forms for use in commercial, legal, or financial transactions,
which are wholly or partly blank and whose value lies in their usefulness
and not in their merit as literary compositions.</p>

<p>Directions on scales, or dials, or mathematical or other <a
name="Page_497" id="Page_497"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
497]</span>instruments; puzzles; games; rebuses; labels; wrappers; formulæ
on boxes, bottles, and other receptacles of articles for sale or meant to
accompany such articles.</p>

<p>Advertisements or catalogues which merely set forth the names, prices,
and places where articles are for sale.</p>

<p>Prefaces or other introductory matter to works not themselves entitled
to copyright protection, such as blank books.</p>

<p>Calendars are not capable of registration as such, but if they contain
copyrightable reading matter or pictures they may be registered either as
"books" or as "prints" according to the nature of the copyrightable
matter.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Periodicals</p>

<p>6. (<i>b</i>) <i>Periodicals.</i>&mdash;This term includes newspapers,
magazines, reviews, and serial publications appearing oftener than once a
year; bulletins or proceedings of societies, etc., which appear regularly
at intervals of less than a year; and, generally, periodical publications
which would be registered as second class matter at the post office.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Lectures, etc.</p>

<p>7. (<i>c</i>) <i>Lectures</i>, <i>sermons</i>, <i>addresses</i>, or
similar productions, prepared for oral delivery.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Dramatic compositions, etc.</p>

<p>8. (<i>d</i>) <i>Dramatic and dramatico-musical compositions</i>, such
as dramas, comedies, operas, operettas and similar works.</p>

<p>The designation "dramatic composition" does not include the following:
Dances, ballets, or other choregraphic works; tableaux and moving picture
shows; stage settings or mechanical devices by which dramatic effects are
produced, or "stage business"; animal shows, sleight-of-hand performances,
acrobatic or circus tricks of any kind; descriptions of moving pictures or
of settings for the production of moving pictures. (These, however, when
printed and published, are registrable as "books.")</p>

<p class="sidenote">Dramatico-musical compositions, etc.</p>

<p>9. <i>Dramatico-musical compositions</i> include principally operas,
operettas, and musical comedies, or similar productions which are to be
acted as well as sung.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Songs separately published</p>

<p>Ordinary songs, even when intended to be sung from the stage in a
dramatic manner, or separately published songs from operas and operettas,
should be registered as musical compositions, not dramatico-musical
compositions. </p>

<p class="sidenote"> Musical compositions</p>

<p><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
498]</span>10. (<i>e</i>) <i>Musical compositions</i>, including other
vocal and all instrumental compositions, with or without words.</p>

<p>But when the text is printed alone it should be registered as a "book,"
not as a "musical composition."</p>

<p>"Adaptations" and "arrangements" may be registered as "new works" under
the provisions of section 6. Mere transpositions into different keys are
not expressly provided for in the copyright act; but if published with
copyright notice and copies are deposited with application, registration
will be made.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Maps</p>

<p>11. (<i>f</i>) <i>Maps.</i>&mdash;This term includes all cartographical
works, such as terrestrial maps, plats, marine charts, star maps, but not
diagrams, astrological charts, landscapes, or drawings of imaginary
regions which do not have a real existence.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Works of art</p>

<p>12. (<i>g</i>) <i>Works of art.</i>&mdash;This term includes all works
belonging fairly to the so-called fine arts. (Paintings, drawings, and
sculpture.)</p>

<p>Productions of the industrial arts utilitarian in purpose and character
are not subject to copyright registration, even if artistically made or
ornamented.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Toys, games, etc.</p>

<p>No copyright exists in toys, games, dolls, advertising novelties,
instruments or tools of any kind, glassware, embroideries, garments,
laces, woven fabrics, or any similar articles.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Reproductions of works of art</p>

<p>13. (<i>h</i>) <i>Reproductions of works of art.</i>&mdash;This term
refers to such reproductions (engravings, woodcuts, etchings, casts, etc.)
as contain in themselves an artistic element distinct from that of the
original work of art which has been reproduced.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Drawings or plastic works</p>

<p>14. (<i>i</i>) <i>Drawings or plastic works of a scientific or
technical character.</i>&mdash;This term includes diagrams or models
illustrating scientific or technical works, architects' plans, designs for
engineering work, etc.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Photographs</p>

<p>15. (<i>j</i>) <i>Photographs.</i>&mdash;This term covers all positive
prints from photographic negatives, including those from moving picture
films (the entire series being counted as a single photograph), but not
photogravures, half tones, and other photo-engravings. </p>

<p class="sidenote"> Prints and pictorial illustrations</p>

<p><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
499]</span>16. (<i>k</i>) <i>Prints and pictorial
illustrations.</i>&mdash;This term comprises all printed pictures not
included in the various other classes enumerated above.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Articles for use not copyrightable</p>

<p>Articles of utilitarian purpose do not become capable of copyright
registration because they consist in part of pictures which in themselves
are copyrightable, e. g., puzzles, games, rebuses, badges, buttons,
buckles, pins, novelties of every description, or similar articles.</p>

<p>Postal cards can not be copyrighted as such. The pictures thereon may
be registered as "prints or pictorial illustrations" or as "photographs."
Text matter on a postal card may be of such a character that it may be
registered as a "book."</p>

<p>Mere ornamental scrolls, combinations of lines and colors, decorative
borders, and similar designs, or ornamental letters or forms of type are
not included in the designation "prints and pictorial illustrations."
Trademarks can not be copyrighted nor registered in the Copyright
Office.</p>

<p class="center p2">HOW TO SECURE REGISTRATION</p>

<p class="sidenote">Registrable works</p>

<p>17. Copyright registration may be secured for:</p>

<p>(1) Unpublished works.</p>

<p>(2) Published works.</p>

<p class="center p2">UNPUBLISHED WORKS</p>

<p><i>Unpublished works</i> are such as have not at the time of
registration been printed or reproduced in copies for sale, or been
publicly distributed. They include: (<i>a</i>) Lectures, sermons,
addresses, or similar productions for oral delivery; (<i>b</i>) dramatic
and musical compositions; (<i>c</i>) photographic prints; (<i>d</i>) works
of art (paintings, drawings, and sculpture), and (<i>e</i>) plastic
works.</p>

<p>In order to secure copyright in such unpublished works, the following
steps are necessary:</p>

<p class="sidenote">Registration of unpublished works</p>

<p>18. (1) In the case of lectures, sermons, addresses, and dramatic and
musical compositions, deposit one typewritten or manuscript copy of the
work.</p>

<p>This copy should be in convenient form, clean and legible, <a
name="Page_500" id="Page_500"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 500]</span>the
leaves securely fastened together, and should bear the title of the work
corresponding to that given in the application.</p>

<p>The entire work in each case should be deposited. It is not sufficient
to deposit a mere outline or epitome, or, in the case of a play, a mere
scenario or a scenario with the synopsis of the dialogue.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Unpublished photograph</p>

<p>19. (2) In the case of photographs, deposit one copy of a positive
print of the work. (Photo-engravings or photogravures are not photographs
within the meaning of this provision.)</p>

<p class="sidenote">Photograph of work of art</p>

<p>20. (3) In the case of works of art, models or designs for works of
art, or drawings or plastic works of a scientific or technical character,
deposit a photographic reproduction.</p>

<p>In each case the deposited article should be accompanied by an
application for registration and a money order for the amount of the
statutory fee.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Reproduction of unpublished work</p>

<p>21. Any work which has been registered as an unpublished work, if
reproduced in copies for sale or distribution, must be deposited a second
time (two copies, accompanied by an application for registration and the
statutory fee) in the same manner as is required in the case of works
published in the first place.</p>

<p class="p2 center">PUBLISHED WORKS</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smaller">DEPOSIT OF COPIES</span></p>

<p class="sidenote">Deposit of copies</p>

<p>22. After publication of the work with the copyright notice inscribed,
two <i>complete</i> copies of the best edition of the work must be sent to
the Copyright Office, with a proper application for registration correctly
filled out and a money order for the amount of the legal fee.</p>

<p>The statute requires that the deposit of the copyright work shall be
made "promptly," which has been defined as "without unnecessary delay." It
is not essential, however, that the deposit be made on the very day of
publication.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Definition of "published work"</p>

<p>23. Published works are such as are printed or otherwise <a
name="Page_501" id="Page_501"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
501]</span>produced and "placed on sale, sold, or publicly distributed"
(<i>i. e.</i>, so that all persons who desire copies may obtain them
without restriction or condition other than that imposed by the copyright
law). Representation on the stage of a play is not a publication of it,
nor is the public performance of a musical composition publication. Works
intended for sale or general distribution must first be printed with the
statutory form of copyright notice inscribed on every copy intended to be
circulated.</p>

<p class="p2 center">NOTICE OF COPYRIGHT</p>

<p class="sidenote">Form of notice</p>

<p>24. The ordinary form of copyright notice for books, periodicals,
dramatic and musical compositions is "Copyright, 19__ (the year of
publication), by A. B. (the name of the claimant)." The name of the
claimant printed in the notice should be the real name of a living person,
or his trade name if he always uses one (but not a pseudonym or pen-name),
or the name of the firm or corporation claiming to own the copyright. The
copyright notice should not be printed in the name of one person <i>for
the benefit of another</i>. The beneficiary's name should be printed in
such cases.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Short form of notice</p>

<p>25. In the case of maps, photographs, reproductions of works of art,
prints or pictorial illustrations, works of art, models or designs for
works of art, and plastic works of a scientific or technical character,
the notice may consist of the letter C, inclosed within a circle, thus ©,
accompanied with the initials, monogram, mark, or symbol of the copyright
proprietor. But in such cases the name itself of the copyright proprietor
must appear on some accessible portion of the work, or on the mount of the
picture or map, or on the margin, back, or permanent base or pedestal of
the work.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Notice upon each copy</p>

<p>26. The prescribed notice must be affixed to each copy of the work
published or offered for sale in the United States. But no notice is
required in the case of foreign books printed abroad seeking <i>ad
interim</i> protection in the United States, as provided in section 21 of
the copyright act.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 502]</span>AMERICAN MANUFACTURE OF COPYRIGHT BOOKS</p>

<p class="sidenote">Works produced in United States</p>

<p>27. The following works must be manufactured in the United States in
order to secure copyright:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) All "books" in the English language and books in any
language by a citizen or domiciled resident of the United States must be
printed from type set within the limits of the United States, either by
hand or by the aid of any kind of type-setting machine, or from plates
made within the limits of the United States from type set therein or, if
the text of such books be produced by lithographic process or
photo-engraving process, then by a process wholly performed within the
limits of the United States; and the printing of the text and binding of
the book must be performed within the limits of the United States.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) All <i>illustrations</i> within a book produced by
lithographic process or photo-engraving process and all <i>separate
lithographs</i> or <i>photo-engravings</i> must be produced by
lithographic or photo-engraving process wholly performed within the limits
of the United States, except when the subjects represented in such
illustrations in a book or such separate lithographs or photo-engravings
"are located in a foreign country and illustrate a scientific work or
reproduce a work of art."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Books by foreign authors</p>

<p>28. Books by foreign authors in any language other than English are not
required to be printed in the United States.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Books printed abroad</p>

<p>In the case of books printed abroad in the English language an <i>ad
interim</i> term of copyright of thirty days from registration made in the
Copyright Office within thirty days after publication abroad may be
secured; but in order to extend the copyright to the full term of
protection, an edition of the work must be published in the United States
within the thirty days <i>ad interim</i> term, printed or produced within
the limits of the United States as required in section 15 of the copyright
act.</p>

<p class="p2 center">APPLICATION FOR REGISTRATION</p>

<p class="sidenote">Application for registration</p>

<p>29. The application for copyright registration required to be sent with
each work (see No. 20) must state the following facts, without which no
registration can be made: </p>

<p><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 503]</span>
(1) The <i>name</i> and address of the claimant of copyright.</p>

<p>(2) The <i>nationality</i> of the author of the work.</p>

<p>(3) The <i>title</i> of the work.</p>

<p>(4) The name and address of person to whom certificate is to be
sent.</p>

<p>(5) In the case of all <i>published</i> works the actual date (year,
month, and day) when the work was published.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Name of author<br />

Nationality of author</p>

<p>30. In addition, it is desirable that the application should state for
record the name of the author. If, however, the work is published
anonymously or under a pseudonym and it is not desired to place on record
the real name of the author, this may be omitted. In the case of works
made for hire, the employer may be given as the author. By the nationality
of the author is meant citizenship, not race; a person naturalized in the
United States should be described as an American. An author, a citizen of
a foreign country having no copyright relations with the United States,
may secure copyright in this country, if at the time of publication of his
work he is a permanent resident of the United States. The fact of such
permanent residence in the United States should be expressly stated in the
application. Care should be taken that the title of the work, the name of
the author, and the name of the copyright claimant should be correctly
stated in the application, and that they should agree exactly with the
same statements made in the work itself.</p>

<p class="p2 center">APPLICATION FORMS</p>

<p>(1) That the copies deposited have been printed from type set within
the limits of the United States; or from plates made within the limits of
the United States from type set therein; or if the text be produced by
lithographic process or photo-engraving process, that such process was
wholly performed within the limits of the United States. Stating, in
either case, the place and the establishment where such work was done.</p>

<p>(2) That the printing of the text has been performed within the limits
of the United States, showing the place and the name of the establishment
doing the work.</p>

<p>(3) That the binding of such books has been performed within the limits
of the United States, showing the place <a name="Page_505"
id="Page_505"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 505]</span>and the name of the
establishment where the work was done. This can be omitted if the work is
unbound.</p>

<p>(4) That the completion of the printing of said book was on a stated
day, or that the book was published on a given date.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Date of publication</p>

<p>Section 62 of the copyright act defines the date of publication as "the
earliest date when copies of the first authorized edition <i>were placed
on sale, sold, or publicly distributed</i> by the proprietor of the
copyright or under his authority."</p>

<p class="sidenote">Affidavit must be under seal</p>

<p>33. The affidavit may be made before any officer authorized to
administer oaths within the United States who can affix his official seal
to the instrument.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Errors by applicants</p>

<p>The applicant and the officer administering the oath for such affidavit
are specially requested to make sure that the instrument is properly
executed, so as to avoid the delay of having it returned for amendment.
Experience shows that among the common errors made by applicants are the
following:</p>

<p>Failure to write in the "venue," that is, the name of the county and
State, and to make sure that the notary's statement agrees.</p>

<p>Reciting a corporation or partnership as affiant. Oaths can be taken
only by individuals.</p>

<p>Failure to state in what capacity the affiant takes the oath, whether
as claimant, agent of the claimant, or printer. Where a corporation or
firm is the claimant, the affiant should swear as agent.</p>

<p>Failure to state the <i>exact date</i> of publication or completion of
printing. The month alone is insufficient.</p>

<p>Failure to sign the affidavit. The signature should correspond exactly
with the name of the affiant stated at the beginning. Corporation or firm
names must not appear in this place.</p>

<p>Failure to obtain signature of the notary after swearing to the
contents.</p>

<p>Failure to obtain the seal of the notary.</p>

<p>Swearing before an officer not authorized to act in the place stated in
the venue. </p>

<p><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 506]</span>
Variance between names and dates as stated in the affidavit and the
application.</p>

<p>The affidavit must never be made before the day of publication.</p>

<p class="sidenote">By whom affidavit may be made</p>

<p>34. The affidavit may be made by: (1) The person claiming the
copyright; or (2) his duly authorized agent or representative residing in
the United States; or (3) the printer who has printed the book.</p>

<p>The person making the affidavit must state in which of the
above-mentioned capacities he does so.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Book in foreign language</p>

<p>35. In the case of a foreign author applying for a book in a language
other than English, no affidavit is required, as such books are not
subject to the manufacturing clause.</p>

<p>In the case of a foreign author applying for a book in the English
language, the same affidavit must be made as in that of an American
author, except where a book is deposited for <i>ad interim</i> protection
under section 21. In such cases the affidavit must be filed when the <i>ad
interim</i> copyright is sought to be extended to the full term.</p>

<p>The affidavit is only required for BOOKS.</p>

<p class="p2 center">PERIODICALS (FORM B)</p>

<p class="sidenote">Periodicals</p>

<p>36. Application should be made in the same manner as for books,
depositing two copies, but no affidavit is required.</p>

<p>Separate registration is necessary for each number of the periodical
published with a notice of copyright, and can only be made after
publication. It is not possible to register the title of the periodical in
advance of publication.</p>

<p class="p2 center">CONTRIBUTIONS TO PERIODICALS (FORM A<sup><span
class="tinier">5</span></sup>)</p>

<p class="sidenote">Contributions to periodicals</p>

<p>37. If special registration is requested for any contribution to a
periodical, <i>one</i> copy of the number of the periodical in which the
contribution appears should be deposited promptly after publication.</p>

<p>The entire copy should be sent; sending a mere clipping or a page
containing the contribution does not comply with the statute.</p>

<p>The date of publication of a periodical is not necessarily <a
name="Page_507" id="Page_507"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 507]</span>the
date stated on the title-page. The application should state the day on
which the issue is "first placed on sale, sold, or publicly distributed,"
which may be earlier or later than the date printed on the title-page.</p>

<p class="p2 center">AD INTERIM APPLICATIONS (FORM A<sup><span
class="tinier">4</span></sup>)</p>

<p class="sidenote">Ad interim copyright</p>

<p>38. Where a book in the English language has been printed abroad, an
<i>ad interim</i> copyright may be secured by depositing in the Copyright
Office one complete copy of the foreign edition, with an application
containing a request for the reservation and a money order for $1. Such
applications should state: (1) Name and nationality of the author; (2)
Name and nationality of the copyright claimant; (3) Exact date of original
publication abroad.</p>

<p>The deposit must be made within thirty days from publication abroad.
Whenever, within the thirty days' period of <i>ad interim</i> protection,
an edition manufactured in the United States is published, and two copies
are deposited, the copyright claim therein may be registered the same as
any other book (Form A<sup><span class="tinier">2</span></sup>).</p>

<p class="p2 center">MAILING APPLICATIONS AND COPIES</p>

<p class="sidenote">Address of mail matter</p>

<p>39. All mail matter intended for the Copyright Office should be
addressed to the "Register of Copyrights, Library of Congress, Washington,

5. U.&nbsp;S. TREASURY AND POST OFFICE REGULATIONS</p>

<p class="center">(T. D. 31754.)</p>

<p class="center">TREASURY DEPARTMENT, <i>July 17, 1911</i>.</p>

<p><i>Collectors and other officers of the customs:</i></p>

<p>The following sections of the copyright law, approved March 4, 1909,
effective July 1, 1909, together with the regulations made in pursuance
thereof, are published for the information and guidance of customs
officers and others concerned:</p>

<p>[Here follow secs. 15, 30, 31, 32, 33, 18, as given in preceding
pages.</p>

<p>The register of copyrights is required by this act to print at periodic
intervals a catalogue of the titles of articles deposited and registered
for copyright, which printed catalogues, as they are issued, will be
distributed to the collectors of customs of the United States and to the
postmasters of all exchange offices of receipt of foreign mails.</p>

<p class="p2 center">REGULATIONS</p>

<p>Under the copyright act the following articles are prohibited
importation:</p>

<p>1. Piratical copies of any work copyrighted in the United States. By
the term "piratical" is meant the printing, reprinting, publishing,
copying, or reproducing without authority of the copyright proprietor of
any article legally copyrighted and on which the copyright is still in
force.</p>

<p>2. Articles bearing a false notice of copyright when there is no
existing copyright thereon in the United States.</p>

<p>3. Authorized foreign reprints of books by an American author
copyrighted in the United States.</p>

<p>4. Authorized copies of any book copyrighted in the United States not
produced in accordance with the manufacturing provisions of section 15 of
the copyright act, except such as are exempted in the said section 15 and
section 31 of the act. </p>

<p><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 514]</span>
All books on which there is an existing copyright in the United States are
prohibited importation unless produced in accordance with the
manufacturing provision of section 15, whether copyrighted under this act
or previous acts. (Opinion of the Attorney General, T. D. 30136, Nov. 24,
1909.)</p>

<p>Copyrighted books produced in accordance with the manufacturing
provisions of section 16 of the copyright act, when exported and rebound
abroad may be admitted to entry on their return to the United States.
(Opinion of the Attorney-General, T. D. 30414.)</p>

<p>As copyrighted books are required to be printed and bound in the United
States, evidence should be required on entry that such books were exported
in a bound condition and not as loose sheets, and that the printing and
binding were both performed within the limits of the United States.</p>

<p>Imported articles found to bear a false notice of copyright will be
detained and forfeiture proceedings instituted as provided in Schedule
32.</p>

<p>If satisfactory evidence is not produced to the collector that such
imported books were produced in accordance with the manufacturing
provisions of section 15, or are exempt therefrom, the books will be
seized and forfeiture proceedings instituted as provided in section
32.</p>

<p>Forfeiture proceedings instituted under the copyright act will be
conducted in the same manner as in case of merchandise seized for
violation of the customs laws, section 32, supra. (Arts. 1266 to 1269,
Customs Regulations, 1908.)</p>

<p>Authorized editions of copyright books imported through the mails or
otherwise in violation of the copyright act may, under customs
supervision, be returned to the country of exportation whenever it is
shown in a written application to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the
Treasury that such importation was not due to willful negligence or fraud.
(Sec. 32, <i>supra</i>.)</p>

<p>In any case in which a customs officer is in doubt as to whether an
article is prohibited importation under the copyright act the articles
should be detained and the facts reported to the department for
instruction.</p>

JOINT REGULATIONS</p>

<p class="blockquote"> Governing treatment of letters and packages
received in the mails from foreign countries containing or supposed to
contain articles prohibited importation by the copyright act of March 4,
1909.</p>

<p>The "Joint regulations governing the treatment of dutiable and supposed
dutiable articles received in the mails from foreign countries" are also
applicable in the treatment of articles which contain or which are
supposed to contain matter prohibited importation by the copyright act,
except as hereinafter modified;</p>

<p><i>Unsealed</i> correspondence and packages (registered and
unregistered) of all kinds which upon examination prove to contain
articles prohibited importation by the copyright act shall be retained by
customs officers, who will notify the addressee of the facts of the case.

the Treasury for permission to return such articles to the country of
export, the customs officers shall take appropriate steps to forfeit the
articles as provided in section 32 of the copyright act.</p>

<p><i>Sealed</i> articles supposed to contain matter prohibited
importation by the copyright act must be appropriately marked to indicate
that fact at the exchange office of receipt. The same conditions shall
apply in regard to the marking, opening, and disposition of such sealed
articles by the addressee or authorized agent as are required in the case
of the opening and treatment of sealed "Supposed liable to customs duty"
pieces. If the customs officer finds an article contains matter prohibited
importation by the copyright act, he shall notify the addressee of the
facts through the postmaster at the office of delivery. If an application
is not then made within a reasonable time to the Secretary of the Treasury
for permission to return the article to the country of export, the customs
officer shall take appropriate steps to forfeit the matter as provided in
section 32 of the copyright act.</p>

<p>Receipt should be taken for articles submitted to customs officials as
prohibited importation under the copyright <a name="Page_516"

record made on the Post Office records of the disposition of such articles
as are not returned to be disposed of through the mails.</p>

General. On receipt of such notices either by the Secretary of the
Treasury or the Postmaster General instructions will be promptly
issued.</p>

<p>1.&mdash;(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, copyright shall
subsist throughout the parts of His Majesty's dominions to which this Act
extends for the term hereinafter mentioned in every original literary
dramatic musical and artistic work, if&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>a</i>) in the case of a published work, the work was

<p class="indent">(<i>b</i>) in the case of an unpublished work, the

<p>but in no other works, except so far as the protection conferred by
this Act is extended by Orders in Council thereunder relating to
self-governing dominions to which this Act does not extend and to foreign
countries.</p>

<p><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg

right to produce or reproduce the work or any substantial part thereof in

<p>and to authorize any such acts as aforesaid.</p>

<p>(3) For the purposes of this Act, publication, in relation to any work,
means the issue of copies of the work to the public, and does not include
the performance in public of a dramatic or musical work, the delivery in
public of a lecture, the exhibition in public of an artistic work, or the

<p class="sidenote">Infringement of copyright</p>

<p>2.&mdash;(1) Copyright in a work shall be deemed to be infringed by any
person who, without the consent of the owner of the copyright, does
anything the sole right to do which is by this Act conferred on the owner
of the copyright: Provided that the following acts shall not constitute an
infringement of copyright:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">(i) Any fair dealing with any work for the purposes of
private study, research, criticism, review, or newspaper summary:</p>

<p class="indent">(ii) Where the author of an artistic work is not the
owner of the copyright therein, the use by the author of <a
name="Page_519" id="Page_519"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 519]</span>any
mould, cast, sketch, plan, model, or study made by him for the purpose of
the work, provided that he does not thereby repeat or imitate the main
design of that work:</p>

<p class="indent">(iii) The making or publishing of paintings, drawings,
engravings, or photographs of a work of sculpture or artistic
craftsmanship, if permanently situated in a public place or building, or
the making or publishing of paintings, drawings, engravings, or
photographs (which are not in the nature of architectural drawings or
plans) of any architectural work of art:</p>

<p class="indent">(iv) The publication in a collection, mainly composed of
non-copyright matter, bona fide intended for the use of schools, and so
described in the title and in any advertisements issued by the publisher,
of short passages from published literary works not themselves published
for the use of schools in which copyright subsists: Provided that not more
than two of such passages from works by the same author are published by
the same publisher within five years, and that the source from which such
passages are taken is acknowledged:</p>

<p class="indent">(v) The publication in a newspaper of a report of a
lecture delivered in public, unless the report is prohibited by
conspicuous written or printed notice affixed before and maintained during
the lecture at or about the main entrance of the building in which the

worship, in a position near the lecturer; but nothing in this paragraph
shall affect the provisions in paragraph (i) as to newspaper
summaries:</p>

<p class="indent">(vi) The reading or recitation in public by one person
of any reasonable extract from any published work.</p>

<p>(2) Copyright in a work shall also be deemed to be infringed by any
person who&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>a</i>) sells or lets for hire, or by way of trade
exposes or offers for sale or hire; or</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>b</i>) distributes either for the purposes of trade
or to such <a name="Page_520" id="Page_520"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg

<p class="indent">(<i>d</i>) imports for sale or hire into any part of His
Majesty's dominions to which this Act extends,</p>

<p>any work which to his knowledge infringes copyright or would infringe
copyright if it had been made within the part of His Majesty's dominions
in or into which the sale or hiring, exposure, offering for sale or hire,
distribution, exhibition, or importation took place.</p>

<p>(3) Copyright in a work shall also be deemed to be infringed by any
person who for his private profit permits a theatre or other place of
entertainment to be used for the performance in public of the work without
the consent of the owner of the copyright, unless he was not aware, and
had no reasonable ground for suspecting, that the performance would be an
infringement of copyright.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Term of copyright</p>

<p>3. The term for which copyright shall subsist shall, except as
otherwise expressly provided by this Act, be the life of the author and a
period of fifty years after his death:</p>

<p>Provided that at any time after the expiration of twenty-five years, or
in the case of a work in which copyright subsists at the passing of this
Act thirty years, from the death of the author of a published work,
copyright in the work shall not be deemed to be infringed by the
reproduction of the work for sale if the person reproducing the work
proves that he has given the prescribed notice in writing of his intention
to reproduce the work, and that he has paid in the prescribed manner to,
or for the benefit of, the owner of the copyright royalties in respect of
all copies of the work sold by him calculated at the rate of ten per cent.
on the price at which he publishes the work; and, for the purposes of this
proviso, the Board of Trade may make regulations prescribing the mode in
which notices are to be given, and the particulars to be given in such
notices, and the mode, time, and frequency of the payment of royalties,

dramatic, or musical work which has been published or performed in public
a complaint is made to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council that
the owner of the copyright in the work has refused to republish or to
allow the republication of the work or has refused to allow the
performance in public of the work, and that by reason of such refusal the
work is withheld from the public, the owner of the copyright may be
ordered to grant a licence to reproduce the work or perform the work in
public, as the case may be, on such terms and subject to such conditions
as the Judicial Committee may think fit.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Ownership of copyright, &amp;c.</p>

work shall be the first owner of the copyright therein:</p>

<p>Provided that&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>a</i>) where, in the case of an engraving,
photograph, or portrait, the plate or other original was ordered by some
other person and was made for valuable consideration in pursuance of that
order, then, in the absence of any agreement to the contrary, the person
by whom such plate or other original was ordered shall be the first owner
of the copyright; and</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>b</i>) where the author was in the employment of
some other person under a contract of service or apprenticeship and the
work was made in the course of his employment by that person, the person
by whom the author was employed shall, in the absence of any agreement to
the contrary, be the first owner of the copyright, but where the work is
an article or other contribution to a newspaper, magazine, or similar
periodical, there shall, in the absence of any agreement to the contrary,
be deemed to be reserved to the author a right to restrain the publication
of the work, otherwise than as part of a newspaper, magazine, or similar
periodical.</p>

<p>(2) The owner of the copyright in any work may assign the right, either
wholly or partially, and either generally or subject to limitations to the
United Kingdom or any self-governing <a name="Page_522"

part of His Majesty's dominions to which this Act extends, and either for
the whole term of the copyright or for any part thereof, and may grant any
interest in the right by licence, but no such assignment or grant shall be
valid unless it is in writing signed by the owner of the right in respect
of which the assignment or grant is made, or by his duly authorized
agent:</p>

<p>Provided that, where the author of a work is the first owner of the
copyright therein, no assignment of the copyright, and no grant of any
interest therein, made by him (otherwise than by will) after the passing
of this Act, shall be operative to vest in the assignee or grantee any
rights with respect to the copyright in the work beyond the expiration of
twenty-five years from the death of the author, and the reversionary
interest in the copyright expectant on the termination of that period
shall, on the death of the author, notwithstanding any agreement to the
contrary, devolve on his legal personal representatives as part of his
estate, and any agreement entered into by him as to the disposition of
such reversionary interest shall be null and void, but nothing in this
proviso shall be construed as applying to the assignment of the copyright
in a collective work or a licence to publish a work or part of a work as
part of a collective work.</p>

<p>(3) Where, under any partial assignment of copyright, the assignee
becomes entitled to any right comprised in copyright, the assignee as
respects the right so assigned, and the assignor as respects the rights
not assigned, shall be treated for the purposes of this Act as the owner
of the copyright, and the provisions of this Act shall have effect
accordingly.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Works of joint authors</p>

<p>16.&mdash;(1) In the case of a work of joint authorship, copyright

of fifty years after his death, or during the life of the author who dies
last, whichever period is the longer, and references in this Act to the
period after the expiration of any specified number of years from the
death of the author shall be construed as references to the period after
the expiration of the like number of years from the death of the author
who dies first or after the death of the author who dies last, whichever
period may be the shorter, and in the provisions of this Act with respect
to the grant of compulsory licences a reference to the date of the death
of the author who dies last shall be substituted for the reference to the
date of the death of the author.</p>

<p>(2) Where, in the case of a work of joint authorship, some one or more
of the joint authors do not satisfy the conditions conferring copyright
laid down by this Act, the work shall be treated for the purposes of this
Act as if the other author or authors had been the sole author or authors
thereof:</p>

<p>Provided that the term of the copyright shall be the same as it would
have been if all the authors had satisfied such conditions as
aforesaid.</p>

<p>(3) For the purposes of this Act, "a work of joint authorship" means a
work produced by the collaboration of two or more authors in which the
contribution of one author is <a name="Page_529" id="Page_529"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 529]</span>not distinct from the contribution of the
other author or authors.</p>

<p>(4) Where a married woman and her husband are joint authors of a work
the interest of such married woman therein shall be her separate
property.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Posthumous works</p>

engraving, in which copyright subsists at the date of the death of the
author or, in the case of a work of joint authorship, at or immediately
before the date of the death of the author who dies last, but which has
not been published, nor, in the case of a dramatic or musical work, been
performed in public, nor, in the case of a lecture, been delivered in
public, before that date, copyright shall subsist till publication, or
performance or delivery in public, whichever may first happen, and for a
term of fifty years thereafter, and the proviso to section three of this
Act shall, in the case of such a work, apply as if the author had died at
the date of such publication or performance or delivery in public as
aforesaid.</p>

<p>(2) The ownership of an author's manuscript after his death, where such
ownership has been acquired under a testamentary disposition made by the
author and the manuscript is of a work which has not been published nor
performed in public nor delivered in public, shall be prima facie proof of
the copyright being with the owner of the manuscript.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Provisions as to Government publications</p>

any agreement with the author, belong to His Majesty, and in such case
shall continue for a period of fifty years from the date of the first
publication of the work.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Provisions as to mechanical instruments</p>

<p>19.&mdash;(1) Copyright shall subsist in records, perforated rolls, and
other contrivances by means of which sounds may be mechanically
reproduced, in like manner as if such contrivances were musical works, but
the term of copyright shall be fifty years from the making of the original
<a name="Page_530" id="Page_530"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
530]</span>plate from which the contrivance was directly or indirectly
derived, and the person who was the owner of such original plate at the
time when such plate was made shall be deemed to be the author of the
work, and, where such owner is a body corporate, the body corporate shall
be deemed for the purposes of this Act to reside within the parts of His
Majesty's dominions to which this Act extends if it has established a
place of business within such parts.</p>

<p>(2) It shall not be deemed to be an infringement of copyright in any
musical work for any person to make within the parts of His Majesty's
dominions to which this Act extends records, perforated rolls, or other
contrivances by means of which the work may be mechanically performed, if
such person proves&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>a</i>) that such contrivances have previously been
made by, or with the consent or acquiescence of, the owner of the
copyright in the work; and</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>b</i>) that he has given the prescribed notice of
his intention to make the contrivances, and has paid in the prescribed
manner to, or for the benefit of, the owner of the copyright in the work
royalties in respect of all such contrivances sold by him, calculated at
the rate hereinafter mentioned:</p>

<p>Provided that&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">(i) nothing in this provision shall authorize any
alterations in, or omissions from, the work reproduced, unless
contrivances reproducing the work subject to similar alterations and
omissions have been previously made by, or with the consent or
acquiescence of, the owner of the copyright, or unless such alterations or
omissions are reasonably necessary for the adaptation of the work to the
contrivances in question; and</p>

<p class="indent">(ii) for the purposes of this provision, a musical work
shall be deemed to include any words so closely associated therewith as to
form part of the same work, but shall not be deemed to include a

sold within two years after the commencement of this Act by the person
making the same, be two and one-half per cent.; and</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>b</i>) in the case of contrivances sold as aforesaid
after the expiration of that period, five per cent.</p>

<p>on the ordinary retail selling price of the contrivance calculated in
the prescribed manner, so however that the royalty payable in respect of a
contrivance shall, in no case, be less than a halfpenny for each separate
musical work in which copyright subsists reproduced thereon, and, where
the royalty calculated as aforesaid includes a fraction of a farthing,
such fraction shall be reckoned as a farthing:</p>

<p>Provided that, if, at any time after the expiration of seven years from
the commencement of this Act, it appears to the Board of Trade that such
rate as aforesaid is no longer equitable, the Board of Trade may, after
holding a public inquiry, make an order either decreasing or increasing
that rate to such extent as under the circumstances may seem just, but any
order so made shall be provisional only and shall not have any effect
unless and until confirmed by Parliament; but, where an order revising the
rate has been so made and confirmed, no further revision shall be made
before the expiration of fourteen years from the date of the last
revision.</p>

<p>(4) If any such contrivance is made reproducing two or more different
works in which copyright subsists and the owners of the copyright therein
are different persons, the sums payable by way of royalties under this
section shall be apportioned amongst the several owners of the copyright
in such proportions as, failing agreement, may be determined by
arbitration.</p>

<p>(5) When any such contrivances by means of which a musical work may be
mechanically performed have been made, then, for the purposes of this
section, the owner of the copyright in the work shall, in relation to any
person who makes the prescribed inquiries, be deemed to have given his
consent to the making of such contrivances if he fails to reply to such
inquiries within the prescribed time.</p>

<p><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg

make regulations prescribing anything which under this section is to be
prescribed, and prescribing the mode in which notices are to be given and
the particulars to be given in such notices, and the mode, time, and
frequency of the payment of royalties, and any such regulations may, if
the Board think fit, include regulations requiring payment in advance or
otherwise securing the payment of royalties.</p>

<p>(7) In the case of musical works published before the commencement of
this Act, the foregoing provisions shall have effect, subject to the
following modifications and additions:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>a</i>) The conditions as to the previous making by,
or with the consent or acquiescence of, the owner of the copyright in the
work, and the restrictions as to alterations in or omissions from the
work, shall not apply:</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>b</i>) The rate of two and one-half per cent. shall
be substituted for the rate of five per cent. as the rate at which
royalties are to be calculated, but no royalties shall be payable in
respect of contrivances sold before the first day of July, nineteen
hundred and thirteen, if contrivances reproducing the same work had been
lawfully made, or placed on sale, within the parts of His Majesty's
dominions to which this Act extends before the first day of July, nineteen
hundred and ten:</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>c</i>) Notwithstanding any assignment made before
the passing of this Act of the copyright in a musical work, any rights
conferred by this Act in respect of the making, or authorising the making,
of contrivances by means of which the work may be mechanically performed
shall belong to the author or his legal personal representatives and not
to the assignee, and the royalties aforesaid shall be payable to, and for
the benefit of, the author of the work or his legal personal
representatives:</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>d</i>) The saving contained in this Act of the
rights and interests arising from, or in connexion with, action taken
before the commencement of this Act shall not <a name="Page_533"
id="Page_533"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 533]</span>be construed as
authorizing any person who has made contrivances by means of which the
work may be mechanically performed to sell any such contrivances, whether
made before or after the passing of this Act, except on the terms and
subject to the conditions laid down in this section:</p>

<p class="indent">(<i>e</i>) Where the work is a work on which copyright
is conferred by an Order in Council relating to a foreign country, the
copyright so conferred shall not, except to such extent as may be provided
by the Order, include any rights with respect to the making of records,
perforated rolls, or other contrivances by means of which the work may be
mechanically performed.</p>

<p>(8) Notwithstanding anything in this Act, where a record, perforated
roll, or other contrivance by means of which sounds may be mechanically
reproduced has been made before the commencement of this Act, copyright
shall, as from the commencement of this Act, subsist therein in like
manner and for the like term as if this Act had been in force at the date
of the making of the original plate from which the contrivance was
directly or indirectly derived.</p>

<p>Provided that&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">(i) the person who, at the commencement of this Act, is
the owner of such original plate shall be the first owner of such
copyright; and</p>

<p class="indent">(ii) nothing in this provision shall be construed as
conferring copyright in any such contrivance if the making thereof would
have infringed copyright in some other such contrivance, if this provision
had been in force at the time of the making of the first-mentioned
contrivance.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Provision as to political speeches</p>

<p>20. Notwithstanding anything in this Act, it shall not be an
infringement of copyright in an address of a political nature delivered at
a public meeting to publish a report thereof in a newspaper.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Provisions as to photographs</p>

<p>21. The term for which copyright shall subsist in photographs shall be
fifty years from the making of the original negative from which the

<p class="sidenote">Works of foreign authors first published in parts of
His Majesty's dominions to which Act extends</p>

or has not undertaken to give, adequate protection to the works of British
authors, it shall be lawful for His Majesty by Order in Council to direct
that such of the provisions of this Act as confer copyright on works first

<p class="sidenote">Application of Act to British dominions</p>

<p>25.&mdash;(1) This Act, except such of the provisions thereof as are

dominion, unless declared by the Legislature of that dominion to be in
force therein either without any modifications or additions, or with such
modifications and additions relating exclusively to procedure and
remedies, or necessary to adapt this Act to the circumstances of the
dominion, as may be enacted by such Legislature.</p>

<p>(2) If the Secretary of State certifies by notice published in the

substantially identical with those conferred by this Act, then, whilst
such legislation continues in force, the dominion shall, for the purposes
of the rights conferred by this Act, be treated as if it were a dominion
to which this Act extends; and it shall be lawful for the Secretary of
State to give such a certificate as aforesaid, notwithstanding that the

of copies of works, manufactured in a foreign country, under the law of
the dominion, differ from those under this Act.</p>

that dominion: Provided that no such repeal shall prejudicially affect any
legal rights existing at the time of the repeal, and that, on this Act or
any part thereof being so repealed by the Legislature of a self-governing
dominion, that dominion shall cease to be a dominion to which this Act
extends.</p>

<p>(2) In any self-governing dominion to which this Act does not extend,
the enactments repealed by this Act shall, so far as they are operative in
that dominion, continue in force until repealed by the Legislature of that
dominion.</p>

<p>(3) Where His Majesty in Council is satisfied that the law of a
self-governing dominion to which this Act does not extend provides
adequate protection within the dominion for the works (whether published
or unpublished) of authors who at the time of the making of the work were
British subjects resident elsewhere than in that dominion, His Majesty in
Council may, for the purpose of giving reciprocal protection, direct that
this Act, except such parts (if any) thereof as may be specified in the
Order, and subject to any conditions contained therein, shall, within the

resident within the first-mentioned dominion, and to works first published
in that dominion; but, save as provided by such an Order, works the
authors whereof were resident in a dominion to which this Act does not
extend shall not, whether they are British subjects or not, be entitled to
any protection under this Act except such protection as is by this Act
conferred on works first published within the parts of His Majesty's
dominions to which this Act extends:</p>

<p>Provided that no such Order shall confer any rights within a
self-governing dominion, but the Governor in Council of any self-governing
dominion to which this Act extends, may, by Order, confer within that
dominion the like rights as His Majesty in Council is, under the foregoing
provisions of this subsection, authorised to confer within other parts of
His Majesty's dominions.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this subsection, the expression "a dominion to

<p class="indent">(i) before making an Order in Council under this section
in respect of any foreign country (other than a country with which His

administrations, will edit a periodical publication in the French language
treating questions which concern the Union. The governments of the

works, the country of first publication, and for works published
simultaneously in  <a name="Page_608b" id="Page_608b"></a><span

country within the Union, it is the latter country which is exclusively
considered as the country of origin.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Published works</p>

<p>By published works ("<i>&oelig;uvres publiées</i>") must be understood,
according to the present Convention, works which have been issued

dramatico-musical work, the performance of a musical work, the exhibition

<p class="sidenote">Under control of Switzerland</p>

working.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Language of Office to be French</p>

<p class="sidenote">Duties of International Office</p>

<p>The International Office collects all kinds of information relative to
the protection of the rights of authors over their literary and artistic
works. It arranges and publishes such information. It studies questions of
general utility likely to be of interest to the Union, and, by the aid of
documents placed at its disposal by the different administrations, edits a
periodical publication in the French language treating questions which
concern the Union. The governments of the countries of the Union reserve
to themselves the faculty of authorizing, by common accord, the
publication by the Office of an edition in one or more other languages, if
experience should show this to be requisite.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Will furnish information as to copyright</p>

<p>The International Office must always hold itself at the disposal of
members of the Union, with the view to furnish them with any special
information they may require relative to the protection of literary and
artistic works.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Annual report of Director of International Bureau</p>

<p>The Director of the International <a name="Page_624b"

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Article 23</span></p>

<p class="sidenote">Expenses of the International Office to be shared by
contracting States</p>

<p>The expenses of the Office of the International Union are shared by the
contracting States. Unless a fresh arrangement be made, they cannot exceed
a sum of sixty thousand francs a year. This sum may be increased by the
decision of one of the Conferences provided for in Article 24.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Method of sharing expenses</p>

<p>The share of the total expense to be paid by each country is determined
by the division of the contracting and acceding States into six classes,
each of which contributes in the proportion of a certain number of units,
viz.:</p>

<table summary="sharing of expenses Berlin">

<tr><td class="left">First class</td><td class="right">25 units</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Second class</td><td class="right">20 units</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Third class</td><td class="right">15 units</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Fourth class</td><td class="right">10 units</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Fifth class</td><td class="right">5 units</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">Sixth class</td><td class="right">3 units</td></tr>

</table>

<p>These coefficients are multiplied by the number of States of each
class, and the total product thus obtained <a name="Page_625b"
id="Page_625b"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 625]</span>gives the number
of units by which the total expense is to be divided. The quotient gives
the amount of the unity of expense.</p>

<p>Each State will declare, at the time of its accession, in which of the
said classes it desires to be placed.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Swiss Administration to prepare the budget of the
International Office, etc.</p>

<p>The Swiss Administration prepares the budget of the Office,
superintends its expenditure, makes the necessary advances, and draws up
the annual account, which shall be communicated to all the other
Administrations.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Article 24</span></p>

<p class="sidenote">Revision of Convention</p>

Union in other respects, are considered in Conferences to be held
successively in the countries of the Union by delegates of the said
countries. The Administration of the country where a Conference is about
to be held, prepares the programme of the same with the assistance <a

admission to all the advantages provided by the present Convention. It
may, however, indicate such provisions of the Convention of September 9,
1886, or of the Additional Act of May 4, 1896, as it may be judged
necessary to substitute provisionally, at least, for the corresponding
provisions of the present Convention.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Accession for colonies or foreign possessions</p>

<p>The contracting countries have the right to accede at any time to the
present Convention for their colonies or foreign possessions.</p>

<p>They may do this either by a general declaration comprehending all
their colonies or possessions within the accession, or by specially naming

<p>For the purpose of the legal unification of the registration, the two

case provided for in Art. 9 of the Treaty on Patents, Trade-Marks, etc.,
of Mexico, and in case the requirements essential to the recognition of
international property are lacking where literary or artistic works are
involved according to the treaty thereon subscribed in Mexico.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Protection to be allowed or refused within one
year</p>

<p>In order that the States forming the Union may accept or refuse the

according to the form prescribed in the preceding articles shall have the
same effect that would be produced if said registration or recognition had
taken place in all of them, and every nullification or lapse of rights
occurring in the country of origin and communicated in the same form to
the others shall produce in them the same effect that it would produce in
the former.</p>

<h3>14. BUENOS AIRES CONVENTION, 1910</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Convention on Literary and Artistic
Copyright Signed at Buenos Aires, August 11, 1910</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Article 1</span></p>

<p class="sidenote">Union to protect literary and artistic property</p>

<p>The signatory States acknowledge and protect the rights of literary and
artistic property in conformity with the stipulations of the present
convention.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Article 2</span></p>

<p class="sidenote">Definition of "literary and artistic works"</p>

<p>In the expression "Literary and artistic works" are included books,
writings, pamphlets of all kinds, whatever may be the subject of which
they treat and whatever the number of their pages; dramatic or
dramatico-musical works; choreographic and musical compositions, with or
without words; drawings, paintings, sculpture, engravings; photographic
works; astronomical or geographical globes; plans, sketches or plastic
works relating to geography, geology or topography, architecture or any
other science; and, finally, all productions that can be published by any
means of impression or reproduction.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Article 3</span></p>

<p class="sidenote">Formalities</p>

<p>The acknowledgment of a copyright obtained in one State, in conformity
with its laws, shall produce its effects of full right in all the other
States without the necessity of complying with any other formality,
provided always there shall appear in the work a statement that indicates
the reservation of the property right.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Article 4</span></p>

<p class="sidenote">Definition of copyright</p>

<p>The copyright of a literary or artistic work includes for its author or
assigns the exclusive power of disposing of the same, of publishing,
assigning, translating, or authorizing <a name="Page_650"
id="Page_650"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 650]</span>its translation and
reproducing it in any form whether wholly or in part.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Article 5</span></p>

<p class="sidenote">Authorship recognized</p>

<p>The author of a protected work, except in case of proof to the
contrary, shall be considered the person whose name or well-known nom de
plume is indicated therein; consequently suit brought by such author or
his representative against counterfeiters or violators shall be admitted
by the courts of the signatory States.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Article 6</span></p>

<p class="sidenote">Authors to enjoy rights secured in country of origin
for like term</p>

<p>The authors or their assigns, citizens or domiciled foreigners, shall
enjoy in the signatory countries the rights that the respective laws
accord, without those rights being allowed to exceed the term of
protection granted in the country of origin.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Works in parts or in several volumes</p>

<p>For works comprising several volumes that are not published
simultaneously, as well as for bulletins, or parts, or periodical
publications, the term of the copyright will commence to run, with respect
to each volume, bulletin, part, or periodical publication, from the
respective date of its publication.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Article 7</span></p>

<p class="sidenote">Country of first publication country of origin</p>

<p>The country of origin of a work will be deemed that of its first
publication in America, and if it shall have appeared simultaneously in
several of the signatory countries, that which fixes the shortest period
of protection.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Article 8</span></p>

<p class="sidenote">Subsequent editions non-copyright</p>

<p>A work which was not originally copyrighted shall not be entitled to
copyright in subsequent editions.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Article 9</span></p>

<p class="sidenote">Translation protected</p>

<p>Authorized translations shall be protected in the same manner as
original works.</p>

<p>Translators of works concerning which no right of guaranteed property
exists, or the guaranteed copyright of which may have been extinguished,
may obtain for their <a name="Page_651" id="Page_651"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 651]</span>translations the rights of property set
forth in Article 3d but they shall not prevent the publication of other
translations of the same work.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Article 10</span></p>

<p class="sidenote">Addresses</p>

<p>Addresses or discourses delivered or read before deliberative
assemblies, courts of justice, or at public meetings may be printed in the
daily press without the necessity of any authorization, with due regard,
however, to the provisions of the domestic legislation of each nation.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Article 11</span></p>

<p class="sidenote">Newspaper articles</p>

<p>Literary, scientific, or artistic writings, whatever may be their
subjects, published in newspapers or magazines in any one of the countries
of the Union, shall not be reproduced in the other countries without the
consent of the authors. With the exception of the works mentioned, any
article in a newspaper may be reprinted by others if it has not been
expressly prohibited, but in every case the source from which it is taken
must be cited.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Newspaper news</p>

<p>News and miscellaneous items published merely for general information
do not enjoy protection under this convention.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Article 12</span></p>

<p class="sidenote">Fragments of literary or artistic works</p>

<p>The reproduction of extracts from literary or artistic publications for
the purpose of instruction or chrestomathy does not confer any right of
property, and may, therefore, be freely made in all the signatory
countries.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Article 13</span></p>

<p class="sidenote">Infringements defined</p>

<p>The indirect appropriation of unauthorized parts of a literary or
artistic work having no original character shall be deemed an illicit
reproduction, in so far as affects civil liability.</p>

<p>The reproduction in any form of an entire work, or of the greater part
thereof, accompanied by notes or commentaries under the pretext of
literary criticism or amplification, or supplement to the original work,
shall also be considered illicit.</p>

<p class="center"><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 652]</span> <span class="smcap">Article 14</span></p>

<p class="sidenote">Fraudulent copies to be sequestrated, etc.</p>

<p>Every publication infringing a copyright may be confiscated in the
signatory countries in which the original work had the right to be legally
protected, without prejudice to the indemnities or penalties which the
counterfeiters may have incurred according to the laws of the country in
which the fraud may have been committed.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Article 15</span></p>

<p class="sidenote">Each government to exercise supervision</p>

<p>Each of the Governments of the signatory countries shall retain the
right to permit, inspect, or prohibit the circulation, representation, or
exhibition of works or productions, concerning which the proper authority
may have to exercise that right.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Article 16</span></p>

<p class="sidenote">Convention to take effect three months after
ratification</p>

<p>The present convention shall become operative between the signatory
States which ratify it three months after they shall have communicated
their ratification to the Argentine Government, and it shall remain in
force among them until a year after the date, when it may be denounced.
This denunciation shall be addressed to the Argentine Government and shall
be without force except with respect to the country making it.</p>

<p class="sidenote">Signed at Buenos Aires Aug. 11, 1910</p>

<p>Made and signed in the city of Buenos Aires on the eleventh day of
August in the year one thousand nine hundred and ten, in Spanish, English,

<h3 class="p4">Transcriber's Notes:</h3>

<p>Use of hyphens and punctuation was standardized. Obsolete and archaic
spellings were retained, including words prefixed with 'un' and 'non.'
Sidenotes are formated in smaller, bold font, and are right-aligned before
the paragraph to which they pertain. Duplicate sequential sidenotes were
deleted when, in the original, they were repeated as the text continued
from one page to the following. Intentional blank spaces in forms and
incomplete dates are indicated with underscores. Index references for
pages 603 through 628 are linked to the 1886 Berne Convention text only
when there is no equivalent text in the 1908 Berlin Convention. In the
Table of Laws and Cases, the last entry for 1908, Harper v. Kalem, is
missing its citation in the original.</p>

<p>A "jump table" was added at the beginning of the index for the
convenience of users.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
